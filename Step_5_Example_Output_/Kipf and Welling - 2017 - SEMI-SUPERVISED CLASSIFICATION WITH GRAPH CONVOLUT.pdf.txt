ABSTRACT
We present a scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured
data that is based on an efﬁcient variant of convolutional neural networks which
operate directly on graphs. In
a number of experiments on citation networks and on a knowledge graph dataset
we demonstrate that our approach outperforms related methods by a signiﬁcant
margin.
 In
a number of experiments on citation networks and on a knowledge graph dataset
we demonstrate that our approach outperforms related methods by a signiﬁcant
margin.
 Experiments on a number of
datasets demonstrate that our model compares favorably both in classiﬁcatio

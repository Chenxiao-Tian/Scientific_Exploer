Methodologies:
These properties are not captured by the mo del generally used before
this discovery, although they play a central role in many con texts like the robustness of the
Internet [6, 15, 19, 20, 49], the spread of viruses or rumors o ver the Internet, the Web or
other social networks [48, 52, 58], the performance of proto cols and algorithms Some models obtain all the w anted properties but rely on
artiﬁcial methods which give unrealistic graphs (trees, gr aphs with uniform degrees, etc).
 This approach could in principle be continued to sample a gra ph among the ones having
a given number of nodes, a given degree distribution anda given clustering. However, until
now, there is no known method to sample uniformly such a graph , and the problem seems
diﬃcult.
 3Note that this algorithm may induce multiple links and loops . One may also use techniques to avoid them,
see for instance [38, 44], b

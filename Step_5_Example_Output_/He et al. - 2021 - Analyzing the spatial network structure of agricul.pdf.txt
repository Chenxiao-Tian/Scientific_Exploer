Methodologies:
The results indicate that (1) the emission network is stable and there is a relationship of control between regions, (2) Central China
is the most important region in agricultural GHG networks; however, the importance of the northwest and southwest has
increased; the northeast has remained relatively independent, (3) influencers are mainly concentrated in the middle of the
Yangtze River and the northwest, while dependentors are concentrated in municipalities such as Beijing and Tianjin, and the
coastal regions in the southeast, and (4) the interprovincial agricultural GHG correlation can be enhanced by shortening the
spatial distance, strengthening economic ties, and increasing the diffusion of technology. Therefore, in this study, we used
the IPCC estimation method to estimate agricultural GHGemissions in 31 provinces in China from five aspects: agricul-

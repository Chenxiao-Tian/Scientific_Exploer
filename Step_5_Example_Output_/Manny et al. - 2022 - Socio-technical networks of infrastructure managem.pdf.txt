Methodologies:
Based 
on these considerations, we suggest analytical methods to study basic network concepts such as density, reci-
procity, and centrality in a socio-technical network. Using the example of urban wastewater systems, we illustrate an 
empirical application of our approach. The results of an empirical case study in Switzerland demonstrate the 
potential of socio-technical networks to promote a deeper understanding of complex socio-technical relations in 
networked infrastructure systems. We contend that such a deeper understanding could improve management 
practices of infrastructure systems and is becoming even more important for enabling future data-driven, 
decentralized, and more integrated infrastructure management.   
 It has been argued that such a holistic analysis of the 
socio-technical nature of infrastructure systems is required in order to 
improve economic and environmental

Methodologies:
Another useful tool is the following result on the expected
sizes of connected components in random graphs with givenexpected degree sequences (21).
 Using a result in (22),the diameter of this subgraph is at most (log n/H11032/H20862logpn/H11032)/H11005(1/H11001
o(1))(log n/H20862((3/H11002

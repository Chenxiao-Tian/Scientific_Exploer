Methodologies:
The exploratory simulations presented here suggest that when a
young, non-porous asteroid (if such exist) suffers extensive impact
damage, the resulting fracture pattern largely deﬁnes the asteroid’s
response to future impacts. These small-world networks result from the immediate drop in L(p)
caused by the introduction of a few long-range edges. Tocheck therobustness of

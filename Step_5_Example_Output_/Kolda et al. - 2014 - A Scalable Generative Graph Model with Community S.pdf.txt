Methodologies:
The generator is
trivially parallelizable, and we show results for a Hadoop MapReduce implementation for modeling a
real-world Web graph with over 4.6 billion edges. A major obstacle to working in theﬁeld of network science is that access to d ata is restricted due to a combination of
security and privacy concerns; yet models , algorithms, software, and hardware are
struggling to keep pace with increasing demands for scalability and relevance. Since our approach generates all edges independently, it can be easilyparallelized. We alsocompareBTERto competing methods
on a pair of smaller graphs.
 However, we hav e recently proposed a sampling method that
scales to very large graphs [ 47,25].
 Unfortunately, SKG has some
drawbacks: (1) It can be extremely expensive to ﬁt to real data (using KronFit, the
SKG parameter ﬁtting algorithm proposed by the SKG inventors), and even then the

Methodologies:
Data-
driven modeling and exploration of cities entail cycles of information management activities – 
from data acquisition and transformation, to structuring and interpreting data to produce 
useful information, to knowledge dissemination for planning and advocacy. Critical 
approaches might identify sampling biases in user-generated content to adjust for over-
representation of certain groups in these datasets and to foreground marginalized voices. 
 Interpretative and narrative approaches can 
enrich and contextualize data-driven urban morphology (Erin et al., 2017; Moudon, 1997). 
 Interpretative and narrative approaches can 
enrich and contextualize data-driven urban morphology (Erin et al., 2017; Moudon, 1997). 
 In particular, it focuses 
on a motivating question: how can user-contributed big data be collected, organized, and 
modeled to explore the various spatial logics resultin

Methodologies:
Abstract For decades, the spatial approach to network analysis has principally focused
on planar and technical networks from a classic graph theory perspective. Reference tomodels and methods developed by other disciplines on non-planar networks, such associology and physics, is recent, limited, and dispersed. In a firstattempt to evaluate the benefits of these approaches in geography, Rozenblat andMélançon ( 2007 ) noticed that “this type of empirical approach combining a conceptual
approach of ‘small world theory ’and dedicated tools has not been developed in
geography ”. In a firstattempt to evaluate the benefits of these approaches in geography, Rozenblat andMélançon ( 2007 ) noticed that “this type of empirical approach combining a conceptual

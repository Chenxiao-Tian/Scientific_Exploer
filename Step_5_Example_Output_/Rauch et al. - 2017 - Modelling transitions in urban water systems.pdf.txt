Methodologies:
This paper presents the ﬁrst step towards
a new generation of integrated planning tools that take such an exploratory planning approach. For example, Rozos and
Makropoulos (2013) and Willuweit and O'Sullivan (2013) use a
common grid based approach, while Doglioni et al. Societal models
frequently apply agent-based approaches to describe functional
relationships. The link with physical reality is provided by cellular
automata methods, with grid cells representing both the spatial
representation of the system and the status of the water infra-
structure. As such, the model aim is not detailed
description of system dynamics but rather to provide a decision-
support tool that enables stakeholders to test possible strategies
and measures; this is known as exploratory modelling (e.g. Bankes,
1993; Dessai et al., 2009; Lempert et al., 2003 ) and is becoming a
standard approach to plan against u

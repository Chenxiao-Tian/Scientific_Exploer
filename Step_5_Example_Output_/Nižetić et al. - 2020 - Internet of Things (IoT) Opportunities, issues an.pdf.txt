Methodologies:
The main outcomes of the review introductory article contributed to
the better understanding of current technological progress in IoT application areas as well as the envi-
ronmental implications linked with the increased application of IoT products.
 Some potential
application areas in IoT technologies are still unknown or insuf ﬁ-
ciently clear on how to approach them which is an evident indi-
cation that more intense research activity should be conducted in
this challenging ﬁeld towards new and important potential bene ﬁts
for society. The previously mentioned approach
would allow for the better treatment of patients, detection ofmedical priorities and support for medical staff in monitoring and
therapy decisions. Based on the conducted review as well as
selected contributions in this VSI the key issues were identi ﬁed,
discussed and highlighted in the conclusion section.2. IoT techno

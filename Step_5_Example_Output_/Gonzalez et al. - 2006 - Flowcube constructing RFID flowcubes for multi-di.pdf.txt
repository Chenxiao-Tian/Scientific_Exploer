Methodologies:
In this paper, we propose a method to construct a warehouse
of commodity °ows, called °owcube . The °owcube di®ers from
the traditional data cube in two major ways. In this paper, we motivate the importance of
the model, and present an e±cient method to compute it
by (1) performing simultaneous aggregation of paths to all
interesting abstraction levels, (2) pruning low support path
segments along the item and path stage abstraction lattices,
and (3) compressing the cube by removing rarely occurring
cells, and cells whose commodity °ows can be inferred from
higher level cells.
 This is a view much
closer to traditional data cubes. Figure 2: Item view: A product can be seen at dif-
ferent levels of abstraction
The key challenge in constructing a data cube for a database
of RFID paths is to devise an e±cient method to compute
summaries of commodity °ows for those item views and path
views t

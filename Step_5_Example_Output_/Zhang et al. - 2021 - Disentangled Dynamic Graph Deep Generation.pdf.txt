Methodologies:
One central
problem in data mining and machine learning for graphs
is the gap between the discrete graph topological infor-
mation and continuous numerical vectors preferred by
mathematical models [ 1]. Such methods usually ﬁt well towards the properties
that the predeﬁned principles are tailored for, but usu-
ally cannot do well for the others [ 7]. Inrecentyears, thesuccessofdeepgenerativemodels
in image and text generation [ 8,9] has been extended
to graph data applications such as molecule design [10]
and protein structure prediction [ 11]. [12] and Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) [ 13],
which rely on highly expressive deep architectures to
map high-dimensional graph-structured data into latent
low-dimensional space, where the latent data points just
follow simple distributions. A plethora of approaches,
including randomized reference models [ 21], stochastic
block models [ 6] and

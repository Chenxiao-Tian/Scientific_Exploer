Methodologies:
Therefore, various techniques have been developed and used to model and analyze the
underlying interactions among the components of the power grid with respect to cascading failures.
 Such methods are important to reveal the essential information that may not be readily available from
power system physical models and topologies. To infer and capture such interactions, data-driven approaches or
techniques based on the physics of electricity have been used to develop graph-based models of
interactions among the components of the power grid. To infer and capture such interactions, data-driven approaches or
techniques based on the physics of electricity have been used to develop graph-based models of
interactions among the components of the power grid. To infer and capture such interactions, data-driven approaches or

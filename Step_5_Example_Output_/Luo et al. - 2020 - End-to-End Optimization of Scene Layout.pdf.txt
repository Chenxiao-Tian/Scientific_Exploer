Methodologies:
Many previous methods have used scene graphs as an in-
termediate representation for downstream vision tasks suchas image synthesis, where they mostly formulate the prob-lem in a deterministic manner. Related Work
Our method is related to the multiple areas in computer
vision and graphics, including scene graph representations,scene synthesis, and differentiable rendering.
 Many of these approaches build upon the recent advance-
ment of large-scale scene repositories [ 28, 20, 36] and in-
door scene rendering methods [ 35, 16, 10]. Many of these approaches build upon the recent advance-
ment of large-scale scene repositories [ 28, 20, 36] and in-

We propose 3D Scene Layout Networks (3D-SLN), a
conditional variational autoencoder network tailored to op-erate on scene graphs. Scene Layout Generator

§Corresponding author. 1.1 Network Analysis in Early Transport Studies
Network analysis is a common and effective approach, considering its elegance in
reﬂecting spatial structures, to study river systems, channel patterns, and road
networks (Haggett & Chorley, 1969). Typically, there are two common ways to extract planar networks:the primal approach and the dual representation. The primal representation is a
natural and intuitional approach, taking route segments as links, and intersections
or ends of them as nodes (Crucitti, Latora, & Porta, 2006; Porta, Crucitti, & Latora,2006b; Scellato, Cardillo, Latora, & Porta, 2006). This method retains the geometric
patterns and geographical properties of transportation systems. It is this reason

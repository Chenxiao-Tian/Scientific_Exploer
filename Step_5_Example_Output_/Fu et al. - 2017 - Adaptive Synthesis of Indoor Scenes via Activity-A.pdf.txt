Methodologies:
We show various synthesis results
to demonstrate the practicability of our system, and validate its usability via
a user study. We also compare our system with the state-of-the-art furni-
ture layout and activity-centric scene representation methods, in terms of
functional plausibility and user friendliness.
 Due to the lack of coordination mechanisms between the cur-
rent solutions to such two subproblems, naively combining these
methods might easily cause undesired results. Due to the lack of coordination mechanisms between the cur-
rent solutions to such two subproblems, naively combining these
methods might easily cause undesired results. Moreover, the current
object exploration methods focus more on pairs of directly related
objects, e.g., a PC on a desk or a human sitting on a chair and using a
desk, while objects with activity relations like bookshelf-chair-desk
groups are rarely

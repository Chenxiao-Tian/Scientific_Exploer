1. Introduction  
Supply Chain Analytics (SCA) refers to the use of data and quantitative tools and techniques to 
improve operational performance (Ha ndfield 2006, Davis -Sramek et al. 2010). Analytics in supply chain 
management (SCM) is not necessarily a new idea (Davenport and O'Dwyer 2011), since various 
quantitative techniques and modeling methods have long been used in manufacturing firms. Analytics in supply chain 
management (SCM) is not necessarily a new idea (Davenport and O'Dwyer 2011), since various 
quantitative techniques and modeling methods have long been used in manufacturing firms. These challenges include issues arising from managing large 
amounts of data (e.g., data availability, data quality)  and dealing with environmenta l uncertainties

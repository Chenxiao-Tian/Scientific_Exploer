ing. In geography and urban studies, it would be about
understanding the evolution of transportation networks,
the human mobility, the spatial structure of urban areas,
etc. and how these dierent factors are entangled with
each other, in order to propose an integrated approach
of scale, mobility, and spatial distribution of activities at
various scales.
 However, it is obvi-
ously impossible to review all the existing results related3
to spatial networks. Rivers form spatial networks (which
in most cases are essentially trees), and result from the
interplay between gravity and the elevation distribution.

Methodologies:
Using topological indicators based on planning parameters, we develop a method of
network division that makes classiÔ¨Åcation of such intermediate networks possible. However, because the research is based on the 
statistical analysis of the macro urban structure, the results cannot have an impact on small regional land planning. Developing a method to describe the structural differences of networks by planning indicators 
is also a difficult issue. However, because the research is based on the
statistical analysis of the macro urban structure, the results cannot have an impact on small regional
land planning. Developing a method to describe the structural di erences of networks by planning indicators is
also a di cult issue. These results show that street network characteristics do play a role in
road safety outcomes. These results show that street network characteristics do play a role

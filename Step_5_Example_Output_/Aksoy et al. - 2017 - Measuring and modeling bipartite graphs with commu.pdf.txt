Methodologies:
More generally, generative models enableunlimited network data generation for computational analysis, for example, varying the characteristicsof the graph to test a graph algorithm under different scenarios. As we see in the results in Section 4.3, these two distributions
may be quite different from one another, in part because the size (and, consequently, the average degree)for each partition may be quite different. Other metrics result by considering the product
graph that is produced by considering just onevertex partition and connecting any two nodes that share a
common neighbour in the bipartite graph. Our experimental results show that this
model is effective at reproducing the degree distributions. Thisextension is not straightforward since the afﬁnity block concept does not carry over easily to the bipartitecase, so we develop a new method for creating the blocks. Computational r

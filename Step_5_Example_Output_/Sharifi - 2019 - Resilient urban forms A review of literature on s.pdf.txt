Methodologies:
Overall, results provide insights about physical properties that are required to design resilient streetsand street networks.
 The paper is structured as follows: research methods and materials
are explained in Section 2. 2. Methods and materials
Resilience is a relatively new, but increasingly popular concept in
the field of urban studies [12,13]. This is a commonly used approach
in many conventional planning policies and practices that assume dis-
asters are predictable and blueprint strategies can be used to deal with
them [4,12,14]. The third and most recent approach
is in stark contrast with the conventional planning approaches. The third and most recent approach
is in stark contrast with the conventional planning approaches. It re-
cognizes the non-linearity, complexity, and dynamism of the system
and acknowledges the insufficiency of static approaches for dealing
with uncertaintie

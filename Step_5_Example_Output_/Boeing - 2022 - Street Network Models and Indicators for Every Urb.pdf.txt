Methodologies:
This article presents the study’s 
reproducible computational workflow, introduces two new open data repositories of ready-  
to- use global street network models and calculated indicators, and discusses summary 
findings on street network form worldwide. Second, it produces an open data 
repository containing street network models for each urban area. Third, it analyzes these 
models to produce an open data repository containing street network form indicators for 
each urban area. Fourth, it presents a summary analysis of urban street network form, reporting the 
first such worldwide results in the literature.
 It places all of the resulting network models, indicators, and code 
into open data repositories for public reuse.
 This article reports the novel methods employed in this modeling and analytics project. 
 In sum, this study produces the first comprehensive public data repository

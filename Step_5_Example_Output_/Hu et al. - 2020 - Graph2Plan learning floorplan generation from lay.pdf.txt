Methodologies:
We conduct both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
ablation studies, and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches.
 One of the hottest recent trends in the field of designs, in particular,
architectural designs, is the adoption of AI and machine learning
techniques. Recent
works on data-driven floorplan modeling include raster-to-vector
floorplan transformation [Liu et al .2017], floorplan reconstruction
from 3D scans Consequently, the constraints may lead to one or
more suitable layout graphs, and in turn, multiple floorplans may
be generated by our method for the user to select and explore.
 Since the CNNs
do not account for relational information between the rooms, the
resulting boxes from Graph2Plan may not be well aligned. We demonstrate with a variety of results, as well as qualitative
and quantitative evaluations, that our learning-based framework is
able to generate hi

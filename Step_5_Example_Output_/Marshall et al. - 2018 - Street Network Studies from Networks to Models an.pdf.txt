Methodologies:
Street networks are, however, complex objects of investiga-tion and the way we model and then represent them as graphs has fundamental effects
on the outcomes of a study. Many approaches to modelling street networks have been
proposed, each lending itself to different analyses and supporting insights into diverseaspects of the urban system. This paper provides an overview of key street network models and
theprima facie merits of pertinent alternative approaches. This cross-disciplinary
interest and the plurality of scholarly approaches and purposes is a welcome sign ofscientific relevance. Yet the lack of communication between these approaches raises
a problem of methodological and terminological fragmentation and entrenchment.

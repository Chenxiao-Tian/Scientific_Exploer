Methodologies:
SATC_readme1
We provide the pedestrian and vehicular data tables used in Hillier
and Iida (2005), which was originally used as part of Penn et al.
(1998), as the Standard Area Test Cases. MIF and the text
table in 'Tables' folder contain some results of space syntax axial
analysis, whereas DXF and the text table in 'TXT' only contain x,
y-coordinates of the lines.

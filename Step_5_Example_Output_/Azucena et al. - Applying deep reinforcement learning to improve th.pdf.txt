Methodologies:
To facilitate the implementation of  DRL in solving such problem s, different 
methods are explored with the help of a permanent database that stores previously 
observed network states without recalculating their polynomials. To calculate all -terminal 
network reliability, numerous methods have been used. These methods provide either an 
exact value or an estimate of the reliability. [ 3] summarizes exact methods for 
calculating network reliability such as exponential time exact algorithms for general 
networks and polynomial time exact algorithms for restricted classes of networks, as well 
as other methods such as bounds on netwo rk reliability, and Monte Carlo simulation. [ 3] summarizes exact methods for 
calculating network reliability such as exponential time exact algorithms for general 
networks and polynomial time exact algorithms for restricted classes of networks, as well

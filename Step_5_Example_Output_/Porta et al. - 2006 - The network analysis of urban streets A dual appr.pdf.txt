Abstract 
The application of the network approach to the urban case poses several questions in terms 
of how to deal with metric distances, what kind of graph representation to use, what kind of meas-ures to investigate, how to deepen the correlation between measures of the structure of the network 
and measures of the dynamics on the network, what are the possible contributions from the GIS 
community. A wide set of network analysis techniques are implemented over the dual graph: in particular the authors show that most of the considered networks have a broad degree distribution typical of scale-free networks and exhibit small-world properties as well.   
   The main result of this flurry of research in the scientific community has been that systems 
as diverse

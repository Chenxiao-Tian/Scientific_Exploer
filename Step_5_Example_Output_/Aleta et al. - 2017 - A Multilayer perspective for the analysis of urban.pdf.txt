Methodologies:
To reconcile both approaches, in this paper we propose an urban transportation model based on multiplex 
networks where both representations are used to extract different information from the system. First, we give an overview of our multiplex representation in the Methods section and then use it to study the structure of 9 urban transportation networks in the first subsection 
of Results. Methods
We start considering each line of each mode of transport as a single layer. In the second part of the results section, however, we will follow a slightly different scheme to add more real 
features to the model. Results
Structure of urban transportation networks.   Data were obtained from a variety of sources, from each company’s website to city’s open data portals, and then arranged as described in the model discussed in Methods. A straightforward approach is to consider the degree of node i a

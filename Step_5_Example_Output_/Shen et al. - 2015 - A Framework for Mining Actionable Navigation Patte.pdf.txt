Methodologies:
To solve thi s problem,  
two types of redundant patterns,  i.e., loop repeat pattern and palindrome -contained pattern 
are recognized and the corresponding processing algorithms  are proposed. The 
experimental results show that the redundant pattern filtering functions are effective and 
scalable.   As a result,  both the walking trajectories of customers 
and the correspo nding purchas e behaviors are automatically recorded in the RFID datasets, which are 
quite precious for mining in -depth knowledge about the shopping behaviors of customers.   
 [24–32] technologies shed s light on 
the above problem, and motivate s us to consider building a bridge between RFID -based indoor 
mapping and advance d data mining technique s to explore customer ’s shopping behavior  in depth . 
 An algorithm which  can filter two types of 
redundant patterns is also proposed. Then, a  simulated shoppin

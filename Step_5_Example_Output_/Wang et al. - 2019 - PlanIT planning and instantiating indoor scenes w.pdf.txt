Methodologies:
We observe that prior work on scene synthesis is divided into two camps:
object-oriented approaches (which reason about the set of objects in a scene
and their configurations) and space-oriented approaches (which reason
about what objects occupy what regions of space). We observe that prior work on scene synthesis is divided into two camps:
object-oriented approaches (which reason about the set of objects in a scene
and their configurations) and space-oriented approaches (which reason
about what objects occupy what regions of space). By decomposing the problem in
this way, PlanIT generates scenes of comparable quality to those generated
by prior approaches (as judged by both people and learned classifiers), while
also providing the modeling flexibility of the intermediate relationship graph

Methodologies:
The success of new scientiﬁc areas can be assessed by their potential in contributing to new
theoretical approaches and in applications to real-world problems. Conclusions and perspectives 385

Appendix 406
1. Introduction
The many achievements of physics over the last few centuries have been based on reductionist
approaches, whereby the system of interest is reduced to a small, isolated portion of the world, withfull control of the parameters involved (e.g. temperature, pressure, electric ﬁeld). There is now a trend in science to extend the scientiﬁc method to become more integrationist
and to deal explicitly with nonlinear phenomena. Despite the formalism and com-prehensiveness of the theoretical results obtained by Erd˝ os and collaborators, random networks
ultimately proved not to be good models for natural structures and phenomena. In fac

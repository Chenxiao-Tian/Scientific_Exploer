Abstract, the scale, the power grid, the traditional
distribution network management model, the requirements, power
grid development, the new situation, The current distribution network oper-
ation inspection, data collection, aninformative and intelligent operation inspection management system, The upper-
level production management system, the lack, operation inspection marketing data, the performance problem, topology data, the distribution network operation, inspec-
tion, this paper, the graph data model, graphic
elements, data migration, a topology map, the intelligent opera-tion, the distribution network, The research, the speciﬁc information, the power system equipment, the phys-
ical relationship, the equipment, a data model, the griddiagram, Graph

Methodologies:
Aiming at the performance problem of thevisualization of topology data in the distribution network operation and inspec-
tion, this paper uses the graph data model to build knowledge, designs graphic
elements for data migration, and forms a topology map for the intelligent opera-tion and inspection of the distribution network. The research clearly and intuitively
displays the speciﬁc information of the power system equipment and the phys-
ical relationship between the equipment, thus forming a data model of the griddiagram.
 Keywords: Graph database ·Topological graph ·Graph data model for power
grid ·Distribution network inspection
1 Introduction
The distribution network is at the end of the power system and has the characteristics
of wide area, large scale, many types, and multiple connections. This paper analyzes and studies the knowledge of graph data model
construction, designs grap

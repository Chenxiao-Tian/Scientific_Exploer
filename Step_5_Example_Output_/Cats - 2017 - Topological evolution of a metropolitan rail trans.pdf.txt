Methodologies:
Identifying patterns and transition points in network evolution and their drivers  
 
Keywords: Public Tra nsport; Network Evolution; Topology; Rail; Infrastructure; Investments  
 
Abstract  
 
The structure of transport networks is the outcome of a large number of infrastructure investment 
decisions taken over a long time span. Nevertheless, network 
exte nsion decisions are often the outcome of interaction s between a large number of playe rs that 
pursue their interests rather than a unified planning proces s. A diverse set of stakeholders stemming 
from multiple co -existing political levels and interests, suc cessive planners and policies that their 
influence changes over time, and, geographical coverage of multiple authorities, all of which have an 
influence on how the network develops. Investments in new rail sections  and stations where a travel 
demand is exp ected  results

Methodologies:
With data-
driven and learning-based approaches receiving more and
more attention in recent years, there has been a steady ac-
cumulation of indoor scene datasets [ 27,36,43,4,19,6,9,

result of reconstruction from raw RGB-D data, while “Amateur” and “Professional” refer to who designed the textures. The 3D scenes, including textured 3D objects, were
recovered by state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction techniques
from the raw scans, which are typically no

Methodologies:
Experimental results show that the proposed modeloutperforms baseline methods on two real-world trafﬁc statedatasets. Experimental results show that the proposed modeloutperforms baseline methods on two real-world trafﬁc statedatasets. Since the volume and variety
of trafﬁc data has been increasing in recent years, data-driven
trafﬁc forecasting methods have shown considerable promisein their ability to outperform conventional and simulation-
based methods [1].

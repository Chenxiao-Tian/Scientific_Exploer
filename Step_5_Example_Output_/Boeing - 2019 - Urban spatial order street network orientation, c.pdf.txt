Methodologies:
These methods demonstrate automatic, scalable,
reproducible tools to empirically measure and visualize city spatial order, illustrating
complex urban transportation system patterns and configurations around the world.
 Although its data quality
varies somewhat between countries, in general its streets data are high quality, especially
in cities (Barrington-Leigh and Millard-Ball 2017 ;B a r r o ne ta l . Analysis
For each city, we calculate the street network ’s edges ’individual compass bearings with
OSMnx using two different methods. The first method simplifies the topology of each
graph such that nodes exist only at intersections and dead-ends; edges thus represent
street segments (possibly curving, as full spatial geometry is retained) between them
(ibid.). In this method, the bearing of edge euvequals the compass heading from utov
and its reciprocal (e.g., if the bearing from utovis

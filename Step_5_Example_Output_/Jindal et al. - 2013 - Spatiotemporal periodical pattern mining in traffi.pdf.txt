Methodologies:
In this paper, we have developed a 
method to mine spatiotemporal periodic patterns in the traffic 
data and use these periodic behaviors to summarize the huge 
road network. In addition to the basic route 
discovery, we can even use this knowledge to develop 
comprehensive methods that take into account the frequently 
traveled roads, the weather conditions, the traffic conditions, and 
so on. There are many challenges in being able to extract such 
information from the raw data. We have modified the period 
detection approach from the KDD’10 paper to fit the needs of our 
dataset, to find the multiple periods in the traffic data.  
 Apart from periodicity finding methods, there have been efforts 
to develop much more comprehensive systems to summarize 
traffic data and use them for various applications. Apart from periodicity finding methods, there have been efforts 
to develop much mo

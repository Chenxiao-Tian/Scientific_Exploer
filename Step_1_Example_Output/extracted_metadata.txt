abstract: Network science is a powerful tool for analyzing complex systems in fields ranging from sociology to engineering to biology. This article is focused on generative models of large-scale bipartite graphs, also known as two-way graphs or two-mode networks. We propose two generative models that can be easily tuned to reproduce the characteristics of real-world networks, not just qualitatively but quantitatively. The characteristics we consider are the degree distributions and the metamorphosis coefficient. The metamorphosis coefficient, a bipartite analogue of the clustering coefficient, is the proportion of length-three paths that participate in length-four cycles. Having a high metamorphosis coefficient is a necessary condition for close-knit community structure. We define edge, node and degreewise metamorphosis coefficients, enabling a more detailed understanding of the bipartite connectivity that is not explained by degree distribution alone. Our first model, bipartite Chung--Lu, is able to reproduce real-world degree distributions, and our second model, bipartite block two-level Erd{\"o}s--R{\'e}nyi, reproduces both the degree distributions as well as the degreewise metamorphosis coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these models on several real-world data sets.

abstract: We propose a generative graph model for electrical infrastructure networks that accounts for heterogeneity in both node and edge type. To inform the model design, we analyse the properties of power grid graphs derived from the U.S. Eastern Interconnection, Texas Interconnection and Poland transmission system power grids. Across these datasets, we find subgraphs induced by nodes of the same voltage level exhibit shared structural properties atypical to small-world networks including low local clustering, large diameter and large average distance. On the other hand, we find subgraphs induced by transformer edges linking nodes of different voltage types contain a more limited structure, consisting mainly of small, disjoint star graphs. The goal of our proposed model is to match both these inter and intra-network properties by proceeding in two phases: the first phase, adapts the Chung-Lu random graph model, taking desired vertex degrees and desired diameter as inputs, while the second phase of the model is based on a simpler random star graph generation process. We test the model's performance by comparing its output across many runs to the aforementioned real data. In nearly all categories tested, we find our model is more accurate in reproducing the unusual mixture of properties apparent in the data than the Chung-Lu model. We also include graph visualization comparisons, a brief analysis of edge-deletion resiliency, and guidelines for artificially generating the model inputs in the absence of real data.

abstract: Public urban mobility systems are composed by several transportation modes connected together. Most studies in urban mobility and planning often ignore the multi-layer nature of transportation systems considering only aggregated versions of this complex scenario. In this work we present a model for the representation of the transportation system of an entire city as a multiplex network. Using two different perspectives, one in which each line is a layer and one in which lines of the same transportation mode are grouped together, we study the interconnected structure of 9 different cities in Europe raging from small towns to mega-cities like London and Berlin highlighting their vulnerabilities and possible improvements. Finally, for the city of Zaragoza in Spain, we also consider data about service schedule and waiting times, which allow us to create a simple yet realistic model for urban mobility able to reproduce real-world facts and to test for network improvements.

abstract: Today, 44\% of global energy has been derived from fossil fuel, which currently poses a threat to inhabitants and well-being of the environment. In a recent investigation of the global demand for energy consumption across various energy consumption sectors, the building sector has been shown to be one of the primary energy consumers, with a high percentage of energy consumption deemed as unnecessary. This as a result of poor management practice and implementation of strategies to avoid excess energy consumption. Over the years, researchers in both academia and industries have focused on various techniques to deal with unnecessary energy consumption and ensuring a healthy living environment for green smart cities. Among these techniques is Smart Home Energy Management Systems (SHEMs), which transform electric home appliances, sensor nodes, into autonomous devices in order to manage energy consumption effectively. This study presents an analysis of smart home energy management system with the goal to identify current trends and challenges for future improvement. The result reveals lack of quality attributes such as security, privacy, scalability, interoperability, and difficulty in managing and adapt to the thermal comfort satisfaction of residents, exposing them to health risks. Lastly, the study described opportunities for future research that ensure energy-efficient smart homes free of unnecessary energy consumption, health challenges, and cyber security attacks.

abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are integrated systems engineered to combine computational control algorithms and physical components such as sensors and actuators, effectively using an embedded communication core. Smart cities can be viewed as large-scale, heterogeneous CPSs that utilise technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), surveillance, social media, and others to make informed decisions and drive the innovations of automation in urban areas. Such systems incorporate multiple layers and complex structure of hardware, software, analytical algorithms, business knowledge and communication networks, and operate under noisy and dynamic conditions. Thus, large-scale CPSs are vulnerable to enormous technical and operational challenges that may compromise the quality of data of their applications and accordingly reduce the quality of their services. This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate data quality challenges in smart-cities large-scale CPSs and to identify the most common techniques used to address these challenges. This systematic literature review showed that significant work had been conducted to address data quality management challenges in smart cities, large-scale CPS applications. However, still, more is required to provide a practical, comprehensive data quality management solution to detect errors in sensor nodes' measurements associated with the main data quality dimensions of accuracy, timeliness, completeness, and consistency. No systematic or generic approach was demonstrated for detecting sensor nodes and sensor node networks failures in large-scale CPS applications. Moreover, further research is required to address the challenges of ensuring the quality of the spatial and temporal contextual attributes of sensor nodes' observations.

abstract: This paper addresses the Internet of Things. Main enabling factor of this promising paradigm is the integration of several technologies and communications solutions. Identification and tracking technologies, wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks, enhanced communication protocols (shared with the Next Generation Internet), and distributed intelligence for smart objects are just the most relevant. As one can easily imagine, any serious contribution to the advance of the Internet of Things must necessarily be the result of synergetic activities conducted in different fields of knowledge, such as telecommunications, informatics, electronics and social science. In such a complex scenario, this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex discipline and contribute to its development. Different visions of this Internet of Things paradigm are reported and enabling technologies reviewed. What emerges is that still major issues shall be faced by the research community. The most relevant among them are addressed in details.

abstract: Maximizing connectivity is one of the most critical requirements in constructing an infrastructure network. In practice, the goal could only be achieved after completing a sequence of possible actions. This work examines an infrastructure network needing reliability improvement concerning all-terminal reliability. Given the initial structure, the objective is to maximize the network's all-terminal reliability by adding edges under several practical constraints, such as the total budget and available types of edges for each step. To solve the complex optimization problem, the potential of using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is investigated in this work. To allow for quick testing and prototyping of the DRL method, a computational environment is developed by integrating OpenAI-Gym and Stable Baselines. Specifically, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent capable of sequentially deciding the addition of new edges in a connected network is created first, and the network structure evolves as appropriate edges are added subject to the total budget that constrains the number and types of available edges at each decision-making epoch. Technically, the proposed computational environment recurrently formulates and evaluates the network's all-terminal reliability by computing the corresponding reliability polynomial. To facilitate the implementation of DRL in solving such problems, different methods are explored with the help of a permanent database that stores previously observed network states without recalculating their polynomials. Numerical examples for given initial structures are provided to illustrate the potential of using DRL in achieving reliability improvements for infrastructure networks.

abstract: Network reliability encompasses a range of issues related to the design and analysis of networks which are subject to the random failure of their components. Relatively simple, and yet quite general, network models can represent a variety of applied problem environments. Network classes for which the models are discussed are particularly appropriate include data communications networks, voice communications networks, transportation networks, computer architectures, electrical power networks and command and control systems. The ultimate objective of research in the area of network reliability is to give design engineers procedures to enhance their ability to design networks for which reliability is an important consideration. Ideally, one would like to generate network design models and algorithms which take as input the characteristics of network components as well as network design criteria, and produce as output an "optimal" network design.

abstract: Complex systems are very often organized under the form of networks where nodes and edges are embedded in space. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks, and neural networks, are all examples where space is relevant and where topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure and the evolution of spatial networks is thus crucial for many different fields, ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. An important consequence of space on networks is that there is a cost associated with the length of edges which in turn has dramatic effects on the topological structure of these networks. We will thoroughly explain the current state of our understanding of how the spatial constraints affect the structure and properties of these networks. We will review the most recent empirical observations and the most important models of spatial networks. We will also discuss various processes which take place on these spatial networks, such as phase transitions, random walks, synchronization, navigation, resilience, and disease spread.

abstract: A proposal for a new way to understand cities and their design not as artifacts but as systems composed of flows and networks.In The New Science of Cities, Michael Batty suggests that to understand cities we must view them not simply as places in space but as systems of networks and flows. To understand space, he argues, we must understand flows, and to understand flows, we must understand networks---the relations between objects that compose the system of the city. Drawing on the complexity sciences, social physics, urban economics, transportation theory, regional science, and urban geography, and building on his own previous work, Batty introduces theories and methods that reveal the deep structure of how cities function.Batty presents the foundations of a new science of cities, defining flows and their networks and introducing tools that can be applied to understanding different aspects of city structure. He examines the size of cities, their internal order, the transport routes that define them, and the locations that fix these networks. He introduces methods of simulation that range from simple stochastic models to bottom-up evolutionary models to aggregate land-use transportation models. Then, using largely the same tools, he presents design and decision-making models that predict interactions and flows in future cities. These networks emphasize a notion with relevance for future research and planning: that design of cities is collective action.

abstract: Street networks may be planned according to clear organizing principles or they may evolve organically through accretion, but their configurations and orientations help define a city's spatial logic and order. Measures of entropy reveal a city's streets' order and disorder. Past studies have explored individual cases of orientation and entropy, but little is known about broader patterns and trends worldwide. This study examines street network orientation, configuration, and entropy in 100 cities around the world using OpenStreetMap data and OSMnx. It measures the entropy of street bearings in weighted and unweighted network models, along with each city's typical street segment length, average circuity, average node degree, and the network's proportions of four-way intersections and dead-ends. It also develops a new indicator of orientation-order that quantifies how a city's street network follows the geometric ordering logic of a single grid. A cluster analysis is performed to explore similarities and differences among these study sites in multiple dimensions. Significant statistical relationships exist between city orientation-order and other indicators of spatial order, including street circuity and measures of connectedness. On average, US/Canadian study sites are far more grid-like than those elsewhere, exhibiting less entropy and circuity. These indicators, taken in concert, help reveal the extent and nuance of the grid. These methods demonstrate automatic, scalable, reproducible tools to empirically measure and visualize city spatial order, illustrating complex urban transportation system patterns and configurations around the world.

abstract: Cities worldwide exhibit a variety of street network patterns and configurations that shape human mobility, equity, health, and livelihoods. This study models and analyzes the street networks of every urban area in the world, using boundaries derived from the Global Human Settlement Layer. Street network data are acquired and modeled from OpenStreetMap with the open-source OSMnx software. In total, this study models over 160 million OpenStreetMap street network nodes and over 320 million edges across 8,914 urban areas in 178 countries, and attaches elevation and grade data. This article presents the study's reproducible computational workflow, introduces two new open data repositories of ready-to-use global street network models and calculated indicators, and discusses summary findings on street network form worldwide. It makes four contributions. First, it reports the methodological advances of this open-source workflow. Second, it produces an open data repository containing street network models for each urban area. Third, it analyzes these models to produce an open data repository containing street network form indicators for each urban area. No such global urban street network indicator data set has previously existed. Fourth, it presents a summary analysis of urban street network form, reporting the first such worldwide results in the literature.

abstract: This paper represents an overview on activities done in real Smart Cities scenarios using IoT Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Nowadays, there are several use cases related to IoT for ITS, such as connected and autonomous vehicles, cooperative transportation networks and smart roads in order to improve data propagation, create heterogeneous connectivity and low latency applications in high capacity environments. ITS techniques can be also applied on logistics, so accuracy on delivery and timing can be improved consider all the involved ecosystems, baseline and standardized architectures in interconnected Smart Cities for future development and integration. Secure correlations between vehicles and smart roads can optimize road safety and traffic flow, reduce incidents, avoid congestions etc. These technologies comprise also V2X (Vehicle to Everything). In this scenario, the cloud-based LoRa (Long Range) and mesh networks technologies, can play an important role for the propagation of intelligent sensed data and localization. The Smart Roads scenario is considered as one of the most attractive field in a Smart City environment. The right choice on technology, delay and frequency represents an important factor to be considered for standardization and engineering activities.

abstract: The structure of transport networks is the outcome of a large number of infrastructure investment decisions taken over a long time span. Network indicators are widely used for characterizing transport network topology and its performance as well as provide insights on possible developments. Little is known however on how rail bound public transport networks and their network indicators have evolved into their current form. This study conducts a longitudinal analysis of the topological evolution of a multimodal rail network by investigating the dynamics of its topology for the case of Stockholm in 1950--2025. The starting year marks the opening of the metro system while the end year is set to mark the completion of the current development plan. Based on a compilation of network topology and service properties, a year-on-year analysis of changes in global network efficiency and directness as well as local nodal centrality were conducted. Changes in network topology exhibit smooth long-term technological and spatial trends as well as the signature of top-down planning interventions. Stockholm rail network evolution is characterized by contraction and stagnation periods followed by network extensions and is currently undergoing a considerable densification, marking a shift from peripheral attachment to preferential attachment.

abstract: One research question crucial to RFID technology's wider adoption is how to efficiently transform sequences of RFID readings into meaningful business events. Contrary to traditional events, RFID readings are usually of high volume and velocity, and have the attributes representing their reading objects, occurrence times and spots. Based on these characteristics and the non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) implementation framework, this paper studies the performance issues of RFID complex event processing and proposes corresponding optimization techniques. Our techniques include : (1) taking advantage of negation events or exclusiveness between events to prune intermediate results, thus reduce memory consumption; (2) with complex events' different selectivities, purposefully reordering the join operations between events to improve overall efficiency, thus achieve higher stream throughput; (3) utilizing the slot-based or B+-tree-based approach to optimize the processing performance with the time window constraint. We present these techniques' analytical results and validate their effectiveness through experiments.

abstract: We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a blackbox differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.

abstract: Random graph theory is used to examine the "small-world phenomenon"; any two strangers are connected through a short chain of mutual acquaintances. We will show that for certain families of random graphs with given expected degrees the average distance is almost surely of order log nlog d, where d is the weighted average of the sum of squares of the expected degrees. Of particular interest are power law random graphs in which the number of vertices of degree k is proportional to 1kbeta for some fixed exponent beta. For the case of beta {$>$} 3, we prove that the average distance of the power law graphs is almost surely of order log nlog d. However, many Internet, social, and citation networks are power law graphs with exponents in the range 2 {$<$} beta {$<$} 3 for which the power law random graphs have average distance almost surely of order log log n, but have diameter of order log n (provided having some mild constraints for the average distance and maximum degree). In particular, these graphs contain a dense subgraph, which we call the core, having n(clog log n) vertices. Almost all vertices are within distance log log n of the core although there are vertices at distance log n from the core.

abstract: The success of new scientific areas can be assessed by their potential in contributing to new theoretical approaches and in applications to real-world problems. Complex networks have fared extremely well in both of these aspects, with their sound theoretical basis being developed over the years and with a variety of applications. In this survey, we analyze the applications of complex networks to real-world problems and data, with emphasis in representation, analysis and modeling. A diversity of phenomena are surveyed, which may be classified into no less than 11 areas, providing a clear indication of the impact of the field of complex networks.

abstract: Traffic forecasting is a particularly challenging application of spatiotemporal forecasting, due to the time-varying traffic patterns and the complicated spatial dependencies on road networks. To address this challenge, we learn the traffic network as a graph and propose a novel deep learning framework, Traffic Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (TGC-LSTM), to learn the interactions between roadways in the traffic network and forecast the network-wide traffic state. We define the traffic graph convolution based on the physical network topology. The relationship between the proposed traffic graph convolution and the spectral graph convolution is also discussed. An L1-norm on graph convolution weights and an L2-norm on graph convolution features are added to the model's loss function to enhance the interpretability of the proposed model. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms baseline methods on two real-world traffic state datasets. The visualization of the graph convolution weights indicates that the proposed framework can recognize the most influential road segments in real-world traffic networks.

Included are important problems in network reliability analysis, namely, computing the probability that a graph is connected and counting the number of minimum cardinality \$(s,t)\$-cuts or directed network cuts. Also shown to be \# P-complete are counting vertex covers in a bipartite graph, counting antichains in a partial order, and approximating the probability that a graph is connected and the probability that a pair of vertices is connected.

abstract: For decades, the spatial approach to network analysis has principally focused on planar and technical networks from a classic graph theory perspective. Reference to models and methods developed by other disciplines on non-planar networks, such as sociology and physics, is recent, limited, and dispersed. Conversely, the physics literature that developed the popular scale-free and small-world models pays an increasing attention to the spatial dimension of networks. Reviewing how complex network research has been integrated into geography and regional science reveals a high heterogeneity among spatial scientists as well as key directions for increasing their role inside multidisciplinary researches on networks.

abstract: With the advent of RFID (Radio Frequency Identication) technology, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers will be able to track the movement of individual objects throughout the supply chain. The volume of data generated by a typical RFID application will be enormous as each item will generate a complete history of all the individual locations that it occupied at every point in time, possibly from a specific production line at a given factory, passing through multiple warehouses, and all the way to a particular checkout counter in a store. The movement trails of such RFID data form gigantic commodity flowgraph representing the locations and durations of the path stages traversed by each item. This commodity flow contains rich multi-dimensional information on the characteristics, trends, changes and outliers of commodity movements.In this paper, we propose a method to construct a warehouse of commodity flows, called flowcube. As in standard OLAP, the model will be composed of cuboids that aggregate item flows at a given abstraction level. The flowcube differs from the traditional data cube in two major ways. First, the measure of each cell will not be a scalar aggregate but a commodity flowgraph that captures the major movement trends and significant deviations of the items aggregated in the cell. Second, each flowgraph itself can be viewed at multiple levels by changing the level of abstraction of path stages. In this paper, we motivate the importance of the model, and present an efficient method to compute it by (1) performing simultaneous aggregation of paths to all interesting abstraction levels, (2) pruning low support path segments along the item and path stage abstraction lattices, and (3) compressing the cube by removing rarely occurring cells, and cells whose commodity flows can be inferred from higher level cells.

abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) applications are set to play an essential role in object tracking and supply chain management systems. In the near future, it is expected that every major retailer will use RFID systems to track the movement of products from suppliers to warehouses, store backrooms and eventually to points of sale. The volume of information generated by such systems can be enormous as each individual item (a pallet, a case, or an SKU) will leave a trail of data as it moves through different locations. As a departure from the traditional data cube, we propose a new warehousing model that preserves object transitions while providing significant compression and path-dependent aggregates, based on the following observations: (1) items usually move together in large groups through early stages in the system (e.g., distribution centers) and only in later stages (e.g., stores) do they move in smaller groups, and (2) although RFID data is registered at the primitive level, data analysis usually takes place at a higher abstraction level. Techniques for summarizing and indexing data, and methods for processing a variety of queries based on this framework are developed in this study. Our experiments demonstrate the utility and feasibility of our design, data structure, and algorithms.

abstract: Massive radio frequency identification (RFID) data sets are expected to become commonplace in supply chain management systems. Warehousing and mining this data is an essential problem with great potential benefits for inventory management, object tracking, and product procurement processes. Since RFID tags can be used to identify each individual item, enormous amounts of location-tracking data are generated. With such data, object movements can be modeled by movement graphs, where nodes correspond to locations and edges record the history of item transitions between locations. In this study, we develop a movement graph model as a compact representation of RFID data sets. Since spatiotemporal as well as item information can be associated with the objects in such a model, the movement graph can be huge, complex, and multidimensional in nature. We show that such a graph can be better organized around gateway nodes, which serve as bridges connecting different regions of the movement graph. A graph-based object movement cube can be constructed by merging and collapsing nodes and edges according to an application-oriented topological structure. Moreover, we propose an efficient cubing algorithm that performs simultaneous aggregation of both spatiotemporal and item dimensions on a partitioned movement graph, guided by such a topological structure.

abstract: Data analysis applications typically aggregate data across many dimensions looking for unusual patterns. The SQL aggregate functions and the GROUP BY operator produce zero-dimensional or one-dimensional answers. Applications need the N-dimensional generalization of these operators. The paper defines that operator, called the data cube or simply cube. The cube operator generalizes the histogram, cross-tabulation, roll-up, drill-down, and sub-total constructs found in most report writers. The cube treats each of the N aggregation attributes as a dimension of N-space. The aggregate of a particular set of attribute values is a point in this space. The set of points forms an N-dimensionaI cube. Super-aggregates are computed by aggregating the N-cube to lower dimensional spaces. Aggregation points are represented by an "infinite value": ALL, so the point (ALL,ALL,...,ALL, sum(*)) represents the global sum of all items. Each ALL value actually represents the set of values contributing to that aggregation.

Title: Mapping Moving Object Events into a Network of Object Flows to Support Decisions
Publication Year: 2016
Journal: No journal information
Other Metadata:
abstract: 1. Recent technological developments have facilitated the continuous identification and tracking of individual objects/ things moving in space. Business analytics tools can handle the resulting vast amount of object tracking data. Thus, tracking technologies could be viewed as information facili-tators that can directly improve decision-making. This research suggests a data-driven approach that transforms the simple object movement events captured by tracking devices in a monitored area into objects' flows composing a network. In addition, we devise two new metrics, the volume and the mobility of the moving objects per flow to characterize the objects movement patterns. The proposed approach offers a structured way to transform massive tracking data into valuable, new knowledge of the moving behavior of objects that can support a wealth of business decisions. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach with real Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) data representing garments' movements in a retail store of a fashion retailer.

abstract: It appeared recently that the classical random graph model used to represent real-world complex networks does not capture their main properties. Since then, various attempts have been made to provide accurate models. We study here a model which achieves the following challenges: it produces graphs which have the three main wanted properties (clustering, degree distribution, average distance), it is based on some real-world observations, and it is sufficiently simple to make it possible to prove its main properties. This model consists in sampling a random bipartite graph with prescribed degree distribution. Indeed, we show that any complex network may be viewed as a bipartite graph with some specific characteristics, and that its main properties may be viewed as consequences of this underlying structure. We also propose a growing model based on this observation.

abstract: Urban street networks derive their complexity not only from their hierarchical structure, but also from their tendency to simultaneously exhibit properties of both grid-like and tree-like networks. Using topological indicators based on planning parameters, we develop a method of network division that makes classification of such intermediate networks possible. To quantitatively describe the differences between street network patterns, we first carefully define a tree-like network structure according to topological principles. Based on the requirements of road planning, we broaden this definition and also consider three other types of street networks with different microstructures. We systematically compare the structure variables (connectivity, hierarchy, and accessibility) of selected street networks around the world and find several explanatory parameters (including the relative incidence of through streets, cul-de-sacs, and T-type intersections), which relate network function and features to network type. We find that by measuring a network's degree of similarity to a tree-like network, we can refine the classification system to more than four classes, as well as easily distinguish between the extreme cases of pure grid-like and tree-like networks. Each indicator has different distinguishing capabilities and is adapted to a different range, thereby permitting networks to be grouped into corresponding types when the indicators are evaluated in a certain order. This research can further improve the theory of interaction between transportation and land use.

abstract: Investigating the regional correlation and factors affecting agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can help establish a regional mechanism for the synergistic reduction of emissions and produce chain-like reductions. Different from the traditional geographical relationship analysis framework, linear analysis ideas, we use social network analysis to discern the regional correlations in agricultural GHG emissions from a relational network viewpoint, clarify the network functions of each node, and explain agricultural GHG correlation from a spatial, economic, and technological viewpoint by nonparametric regression. The results indicate that (1) the emission network is stable and there is a relationship of control between regions, (2) Central China is the most important region in agricultural GHG networks; however, the importance of the northwest and southwest has increased; the northeast has remained relatively independent, (3) influencers are mainly concentrated in the middle of the Yangtze River and the northwest, while dependentors are concentrated in municipalities such as Beijing and Tianjin, and the coastal regions in the southeast, and (4) the interprovincial agricultural GHG correlation can be enhanced by shortening the spatial distance, strengthening economic ties, and increasing the diffusion of technology. Implementing a ``leader--follower'' strategy according to the role of each region and enhancing the intermediator's ``conduit'' role will ultimately lead to the formation of an interprovincial interactive and cooperative emission reduction mechanism.

abstract: Correlations are regularly found in space syntax studies between graph-based configurational measures of street networks, represented as lines, and observed movement patterns. This suggests that topological and geometric complexity are critically involved in how people navigate urban grids. This has caused difficulties with orthodox urban modelling, since it has always been assumed that insofar as spatial factors play a role in navigation, it will be on the basis of metric distance. In spite of much experimental evidence from cognitive science that geometric and topological factors are involved in navigation, and that metric distance is unlikely to be the best criterion for navigational choices, the matter has not been convincingly resolved since no method has existed for extracting cognitive information from aggregate flows. Within the space syntax literature it has also remained unclear how far the correlations that are found with syntactic variables at the level of aggregate flows are due to cognitive factors operating at the level of individual movers, or they are simply mathematically probable network effects, that is emergent statistical effects from the structure of line networks, independent of the psychology of navigational choices. Here we suggest how both problems can be resolved, by showing three things: first, how cognitive inferences can be made from aggregate urban flow data and distinguished from network effects; second by showing that urban movement, both vehicular and pedestrian, are shaped far more by the geometrical and topological properties of the grid than by its metric properties; and third by demonstrating that the influence of these factors on movement is a cognitive, not network, effect.

keywords: deep generative modeling,floorplan generation,layout graph
abstract: We introduce a learning framework for automated floorplan generation which combines generative modeling using deep neural networks and user-in-the-loop designs to enable human users to provide sparse design constraints. Such constraints are represented by a layout graph. The core component of our learning framework is a deep neural network, Graph2Plan, which converts a layout graph, along with a building boundary, into a floorplan that fulfills both the layout and boundary constraints. Given an input building boundary, we allow a user to specify room counts and other layout constraints, which are used to retrieve a set of floorplans, with their associated layout graphs, from a database. For each retrieved layout graph, along with the input boundary, Graph2Plan first generates a corresponding raster floorplan image, and then a refined set of boxes representing the rooms. Graph2Plan is trained on RPLAN, a large-scale dataset consisting of 80K annotated floorplans. The network is mainly based on convolutional processing over both the layout graph, via a graph neural network (GNN), and the input building boundary, as well as the raster floorplan images, via conventional image convolution. We demonstrate the quality and versatility of our floorplan generation framework in terms of its ability to cater to different user inputs. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, ablation studies, and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches.

abstract: This paper proposes a novel generalization model for selecting characteristic streets in an urban street network. This model retains the central structure of a street network. It relies on a structural representation of a street network using graph principles where vertices represent named streets and links represent street intersections. Based on this representation, so-called connectivity graph, centrality measures are introduced to qualify the status of each individual vertex within the graph. We show that these measures can be used for characterizing the structural properties of an urban street network, and for the selection of important streets. The proposed approach is validated by a case study applied to a middle-sized Swedish city.

abstract: We seek to automate the design of molecules based on specific chemical properties. In computational terms, this task involves continuous embedding and generation of molecular graphs. Our primary contribution is the direct realization of molecular graphs, a task previously approached by generating linear SMILES strings instead of graphs. Our junction tree variational autoencoder generates molecular graphs in two phases, by first generating a tree-structured scaffold over chemical substructures, and then combining them into a molecule with a graph message passing network. This approach allows us to incrementally expand molecules while maintaining chemical validity at every step. We evaluate our model on multiple tasks ranging from molecular generation to optimization. Across these tasks, our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.

abstract: The widespread use of road sensors has generated huge amount of traffic data, which can be mined and put to various different uses. Finding frequent trajectories from the road network of a big city helps in summarizing the way the traffic behaves in the city. It can be very useful in city planning and traffic routing mechanisms, and may be used to suggest the best routes given the region, road, time of day, day of week, season, weather, and events etc. Other than the frequent patterns, even the events that are not so frequent, such as those observed when there is heavy snowfall, other extreme weather conditions, long traffic jams, accidents, etc. might actually follow a periodic occurrence, and hence might be useful to mine. This problem of mining the frequent patterns from road traffic data has been addressed in previous works using the context knowledge of the road network of the city. In this paper, we have developed a method to mine spatiotemporal periodic patterns in the traffic data and use these periodic behaviors to summarize the huge road network. The first step is to find periodic patterns from the speed data of individual road sensor stations, and use their periods to represent the station's periodic behavior using probability distribution matrices. Then, we use density-based clustering to cluster the sensors on the road network based on the similarities between their periodic behavior as well as their geographical distance, thus combining similar nodes to form a road network with larger but fewer nodes.

abstract: How does a `normal' computer (or social) network look like? How can we spot `abnormal' sub-networks in the Internet, or web graph? The answer to such questions is vital for outlier detection (terrorist networks, or illegal money-laundering rings), forecasting, and simulations (``how will a computer virus spread?'').The heart of the problem is finding the properties of real graphs that seem to persist over multiple disciplines. We list such ``laws'' and, more importantly, we propose a simple, parsimonious model, the ``recursive matrix'' (R-MAT) model, which can quickly generate realistic graphs, capturing the essence of each graph in only a few parameters. Contrary to existing generators, our model can trivially generate weighted, directed and bipartite graphs; it subsumes the celebrated Erd{\H o}s-R{\'e}nyi model as a special case; it can match the power law behaviors, as well as the deviations from them (like the ``winner does not take it all'' model of Pennock et al. [21]). We present results on multiple, large real graphs, where we show that our parameter fitting algorithm (AutoMAT-fast) fits them very well.

abstract: How do real graphs evolve over time? What are ``normal'' growth patterns in social, technological, and information networks? Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time. Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of edges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)). Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a ``forest fire'' spreading process, that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the ``flammability'' of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study. We also notice that the ``forest fire'' model exhibits a sharp transition between sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying. Graphs with decreasing distance between the nodes are generated around this transition point.

keywords: Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
archiveprefix: arxiv
abstract: Object detection, scene graph generation and region captioning, which are three scene understanding tasks at different semantic levels, are tied together: scene graphs are generated on top of objects detected in an image with their pairwise relationship predicted, while region captioning gives a language description of the objects, their attributes, relations, and other context information. In this work, to leverage the mutual connections across semantic levels, we propose a novel neural network model, termed as Multi-level Scene Description Network (denoted as MSDN), to solve the three vision tasks jointly in an end-to-end manner. Objects, phrases, and caption regions are first aligned with a dynamic graph based on their spatial and semantic connections. Then a feature refining structure is used to pass messages across the three levels of semantic tasks through the graph. We benchmark the learned model on three tasks, and show the joint learning across three tasks with our proposed method can bring mutual improvements over previous models. Particularly, on the scene graph generation task, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-art method with more than 3\% margin.

keywords: Hydrogen fueling station,Hydrogen supply chain network,Integration,MILP,Optimization model
abstract: This paper focuses on developing a mathematical model that covers the entire hydrogen supply network. The classical hydrogen supply chain network design (HSCND) model is integrated with the hydrogen fueling station planning (HFSP) model to generate a new formulation. The proposed model considers the feedstock supply, the installation and operation of hydrogen facilities, the operation of transportation technologies, and the carbon capture and storage (CCS) system. Two primary hydrogen fueling technologies, namely on-site fueling (hydrogen is produced on-site) and standard fueling (hydrogen is delivered by road), are considered. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that minimizes the least cost of hydrogen (LCOH). The necessity of considering various components within a single framework is demonstrated through a case study in Franche-Comt{\'e}, France. The role of each key model component (such as the fueling technology, feedstock transportation, and CCS system) is analyzed. The proposed model is capable of studying the interactions that exist between different parts of a hydrogen supply network. Consequently, more comprehensive construction plans for the HSCN are guaranteed.

abstract: Graphs are often used to organize data because of their simple topological structure, and therefore play a key role in machine learning. And it turns out that the low-dimensional embedded representation obtained by graph representation learning are extremely useful in various typical tasks, such as node classification, content recommendation and link prediction. However, the existing methods mostly start from the microstructure (i.e., the edges) in the graph, ignoring the mesoscopic structure (high-order local structure). Here, we propose wGCN -- a novel framework that utilizes random walk to obtain the node-specific mesoscopic structures of the graph, and utilizes these mesoscopic structures to reconstruct the graph And organize the characteristic information of the nodes. Our method can effectively generate node embeddings for previously unseen data, which has been proven in a series of experiments conducted on citation networks and social networks (our method has advantages over baseline methods). We believe that combining high-order local structural information can more efficiently explore the potential of the network, which will greatly improve the learning efficiency of graph neural network and promote the establishment of new learning models.

abstract: As a strategic factor for a country to survive in the global competition, transportation systems have attracted extensive attention from different disciplines for a long time. Since the introduction of complex network theory in the last decade, however, studies on transport systems have witnessed dramatic progress. Most roads, streets, and rails are organized as a network pattern, while link flows, travel time, or geographical distance are regarded as weights. In this article, the authors will present the current state of topological research on transportation systems under a complex network framework, as well as the efforts and challenges that have been made in the last decade. First, different kinds of transportation systems should be generalized as networks in different ways, which will be explained in the first part of this paper. We follow this by summarizing network measures that describe topological characteristics of transportation networks. Then we discuss the empirical observations from the last decade on real transportation systems at a variety of spatial scales. This paper concludes with some important challenges and open research frontiers in this field.

abstract: Smart City aims to develop an environment in which different things goes to different people. The smart city provides a core infrastructure by improving the status of the inhabitants by providing a smart environment by applying Smart Solutions. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a revolutionary concept which finds its way in many applications such as business, industry, healthcare, Transportation, modern Information Technology applications and many more. IoT combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be applied to many day to day applications in superior systems like transportation, robotics, industrial, and automation systems applications. This research focuses on developing a robotic behavior control using the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) using deep learning for a Smart City. The IoRT is a promising standard that brings together autonomous robotic systems in the midst of the IoT vision of connected sensors and smart objects pervasively embedded in the day to day environments. Robotic behavioral control models the robot with the essential features to react with the immediate environment via sensory-motor links. Robotic behavioral control has a direct interconnection between the sensors and actuators and controls the functions necessary to move around the environment and carry out necessary tasks. This deep learning solution applied to the robotic behavioral control for robotic application uses two main paradigms: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Imitation Learning (IL).DRL merges the concept of deep learning architecture using neural networks and Reinforcement learning algorithms to identify the behavior of the robots.IL focus on imitating human learning or expert demonstration for controlling the robot behavior. The behavior of the robot is monitored in a diner and its performance is estimated to be 92\% in realtime

abstract: We propose an end-to-end variational generative model for scene layout synthesis conditioned on scene graphs. Unlike unconditional scene layout generation, we use scene graphs as an abstract but general representation to guide the synthesis of diverse scene layouts that satisfy relationships included in the scene graph. This gives rise to more flexible control over the synthesis process, allowing various forms of inputs such as scene layouts extracted from sentences or inferred from a single color image. Using our conditional layout synthesizer, we can generate various layouts that share the same structure of the input example. In addition to this conditional generation design, we also integrate a differentiable rendering module that enables layout refinement using only 2D projections of the scene. Given a depth and a semantics map, the differentiable rendering module enables optimizing over the synthesized layout to fit the given input in an analysis-by-synthesis fashion. Experiments suggest that our model achieves higher accuracy and diversity in conditional scene synthesis and allows exemplar-based scene generation from various input forms.

abstract: Networked infrastructure systems --- including energy, transportation, water, and wastewater systems --- provide essential services to society. Globally, these services are undergoing major transformative processes such as digitalization, decentralization, or integrated management. Such processes not only depend on technical changes in infrastructure systems but also include important social and socio-technical dimensions. In this article, we propose a socio-technical network perspective to study the ensemble of social actors and technical elements involved in an infrastructure system, and their complex relations. We conceptualize structurally explicit socio-technical networks of networked infrastructure systems based on methodological considerations from network analysis and draw on concepts from socio-technical system theories and social-ecological network studies. Based on these considerations, we suggest analytical methods to study basic network concepts such as density, reciprocity, and centrality in a socio-technical network. We illustrate socio-technical motifs, i.e., meaningful sub-structures in socio-technical networks of infrastructure management. Drawing on these, we describe how infrastructure systems can be analyzed in terms of digitalization, decentralization, and integrated management from a socio-technical network perspective. Using the example of urban wastewater systems, we illustrate an empirical application of our approach. The results of an empirical case study in Switzerland demonstrate the potential of socio-technical networks to promote a deeper understanding of complex socio-technical relations in networked infrastructure systems. We contend that such a deeper understanding could improve management practices of infrastructure systems and is becoming even more important for enabling future data-driven, decentralized, and more integrated infrastructure management.

abstract: Over the last fifty years, research into street networks has gained prominence with a rapidly growing number of studies across disparate disciplines. These studies investigate a wide range of phenomena using a wealth of data and diverse analytical techniques. Starting within the fields of transport or infrastructure engineering, street networks have commonly been treated as sets of more or less homogeneous linear elements, connecting locations and intersecting at junctions. This view is commonly represented as a graph, which provides a common and rigorous formalisation accessible across disciplines and is particularly well-suited for problems such as flow optimisation and routing. Street networks are, however, complex objects of investigation and the way we model and then represent them as graphs has fundamental effects on the outcomes of a study. Many approaches to modelling street networks have been proposed, each lending itself to different analyses and supporting insights into diverse aspects of the urban system. Yet, this plurality and the relation between different models remains relatively obscure and unexplored. The motivations for adopting a given model of the network are also not always clear and often seem to follow disciplinary traditions. This paper provides an overview of key street network models and the prima facie merits of pertinent alternative approaches. It suggests greater attention to consistent use of terms and concepts, of graph representations and practical applications, and concludes with suggestions for possible ways forward.

abstract: Understanding and analyzing cascading failures in power grids have been the focus of many researchers for years. However, the complex interactions among the large number of components in these systems and their contributions to cascading failures are not yet completely understood. Therefore, various techniques have been developed and used to model and analyze the underlying interactions among the components of the power grid with respect to cascading failures. Such methods are important to reveal the essential information that may not be readily available from power system physical models and topologies. In general, the influences and interactions among the components of the system may occur both locally and at distance due to the physics of electricity governing the power flow dynamics as well as other functional and cyber dependencies among the components of the system. To infer and capture such interactions, data-driven approaches or techniques based on the physics of electricity have been used to develop graph-based models of interactions among the components of the power grid. In this survey, various methods of developing interaction graphs as well as studies on the reliability and cascading failure analysis of power grids using these graphs have been reviewed.

abstract: This paper proposes a generative adversarial layout refinement network for automated floorplan generation. Our architecture is an integration of a graph-constrained relational GAN and a conditional GAN, where a previously generated layout becomes the next input constraint, enabling iterative refinement. A surprising discovery of our research is that a simple non-iterative training process, dubbed component-wise GT-conditioning, is effective in learning such a generator. The iterative generator further allows us to improve a metric of choice via meta-optimization techniques by controlling when to pass which input constraints during iterative refinement. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluation based on the three standard metrics demonstrate that the proposed system makes significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art, even competitive against the ground-truth floorplans, designed by professional architects.

abstract: The rapid development and implementation of smart and IoT (Internet of Things) based technologies have allowed for various possibilities in technological advancements for different aspects of life. The main goal of IoT technologies is to simplify processes in different fields, to ensure a better efficiency of systems (technologies or specific processes) and finally to improve life quality. Sustainability has become a key issue for population where the dynamic development of IoT technologies is bringing different useful benefits, but this fast development must be carefully monitored and evaluated from an environmental point of view to limit the presence of harmful impacts and ensure the smart utilization of limited global resources. Significant research efforts are needed in the previous sense to carefully investigate the pros and cons of IoT technologies. This review editorial is partially directed on the research contributions presented at the 4th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies held in Split and Bol, Croatia, in 2019 (SpliTech 2019) as well as on recent findings from literature. The SpliTech2019 conference was a valuable event that successfully linked different engineering professions, industrial experts and finally researchers from academia. The focus of the conference was directed towards key conference tracks such as Smart City, Energy/Environment, e-Health and Engineering Modelling. The research presented and discussed at the SpliTech2019 conference helped to understand the complex and intertwined effects of IoT technologies on societies and their potential effects on sustainability in general. Various application areas of IoT technologies were discussed as well as the progress made. Four main topical areas were discussed in the herein editorial, i.e. latest advancements in the further fields: (i) IoT technologies in Sustainable Energy and Environment, (ii) IoT enabled Smart City, (iii) E-health e Ambient assisted living systems (iv) IoT technologies in Transportation and Low Carbon Products. The main outcomes of the review introductory article contributed to the better understanding of current technological progress in IoT application areas as well as the environmental implications linked with the increased application of IoT products.

Title: Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network for Long-Term Traffic Flow Prediction with Reinforcement Learning

abstract: Exploiting deep learning techniques for traffic flow prediction has become increasingly widespread. Most existing studies combine CNN or GCN with recurrent neural network to extract the spatio-temporal features in traffic networks. The traffic networks can be naturally modeled as graphs which are effective to capture the topology and spatial correlations among road links. The issue is that the traffic network is dynamic due to the continuous changing of the traffic environment. Compared with the static graph, the dynamic graph can better reflect the spatio-temporal features of the traffic network. However, in practical applications, due to the limited accuracy and timeliness of data, it is hard to generate graph structures through frequent statistical data. Therefore, it is necessary to design a method to overcome data defects in traffic flow prediction. In this paper, we propose a long-term traffic flow prediction method based on dynamic graphs. The traffic network is modeled by dynamic traffic flow probability graphs, and graph convolution is performed on the dynamic graphs to learn spatial features, which are then combined with LSTM units to learn temporal features. In particular, we further propose to use graph convolutional policy network based on reinforcement learning to generate dynamic graphs when the dynamic graphs are incomplete due to the data sparsity i sue. By testing our method on city-bike data in New York City, it demonstrates that our model can achieve stable and effective long-term predictions of traffic flow, and can reduce the impact of data defects on prediction results.

abstract: Recent developments in smart sensing technologies have fostered the wide-spread utilization of smart city applications, which rely on Internet of Things (IoT) frameworks to work efficiently. The terms ``smart city'' and ``IoT framework'', however, have been given several definitions, without consensus. Consequently, definitions of the terms ``smart city'' and ``IoT framework'' need to be condensed, consolidating concepts and guidelines of smart cities and IoT frameworks, as will be shown in this study. In addition, a systematic survey of IoT frameworks for smart city applications is presented, summarizing and comparing the technologies and architectures of IoT frameworks for smart city applications. As a result of this study, trends in IoT frameworks for smart city applications and a definition of the term ``smart city'' are provided. Materializing the findings achieved in this study, an abstract IoT framework concept for smart city applications is proposed. It is expected that the definition of the term ``smart city'' may be used as a basis for a generally accepted formal definition and that the proposed IoT framework concept may provide a strong foundation for successful IoT framework implementations in the context of smart city applications.

keywords: Scale-free networks,Structure of complex networks
abstract: The application of the network approach to the urban case poses several questions in terms of how to deal with metric distances, what kind of graph representation to use, what kind of measures to investigate, how to deepen the correlation between measures of the structure of the network and measures of the dynamics on the network, what are the possible contributions from the GIS community. In this paper, the author considers six cases of urban street networks characterized by different patterns and historical roots. The authors propose a representation of the street networks based firstly on a primal graph, where intersections are turned into nodes and streets into edges. In a second step, a dual graph, where streets are nodes and intersections are edges, is constructed by means of a generalization model named Intersection Continuity Negotiation, which allows to acknowledge the continuity of streets over a plurality of edges. Finally, the authors address a comparative study of some structural properties of the dual graphs, seeking significant similarities among clusters of cases. A wide set of network analysis techniques are implemented over the dual graph: in particular the authors show that the absence of any clue of assortativity differentiates urban street networks from other non-geographic systems and that most of the considered networks have a broad degree distribution typical of scale-free networks and exhibit small-world properties as well.

abstract: The network metaphor in the analysis of urban and territorial cases has a long tradition, especially in transportation or land-use planning and economic geography. More recently, urban design has brought its contribution by means of the `space syntax' methodology. All these approaches-though under different terms like `accessibility', `proximity', `integration' `connectivity', `cost', or `effort'-focus on the idea that some places (or streets) are more important than others because they are more central. The study of centrality in complex systems, however, originated in other scientific areas, namely in structural sociology, well before its use in urban studies; moreover, as a structural property of the system, centrality has never been extensively investigated metrically in geographic networks as it has been topologically in a wide range of other relational networks such as social, biological, or technological ones. After a previous work on some structural properties of the primal graph representation of urban street networks, in this paper we provide an in-depth investigation of centrality in the primal approach as compared with the dual one. We introduce multiple centrality assessment (MCA), a methodology for geographic network analysis, which is defined and implemented on four 1-square-mile urban street systems. MCA provides a different perspective from space syntax in that: (1) it is based on primal, rather than dual, street graphs; (2) it works within a metric, rather than topological, framework; (3) it investigates a plurality of peer centrality indices rather than a single index. We show that, in the MCA primal approach, much more than in the dual approach, some centrality indices nicely capture the `skeleton' of the urban structure that impacts so much on spatial cognition and collective behaviours. Moreover, the distributions of centrality in self-organized cities are different from those in planned cities.

abstract: Several enumeration and reliability problems are shown to be P-complete, and hence, at least as hard as NP-complete problems. Included are important problems in network reliability analysis, namely, computing the probability that a graph is connected and counting the number of minimum cardinality (s, t)-cuts or directed network cuts. Also shown to be P-complete are counting vertex covers in a bipartite graph, counting antichains in a partial order, and approximating the probability that a graph is connected and the probability that a pair of vertices is connected.

abstract: As the scale of the power grid continues to expand, the traditional distribution network management model cannot meet the requirements of power grid development under the new situation. The current distribution network operation inspection still lacks in data collection, and it is impossible to establish an informative and intelligent operation inspection management system. The upper-level production management system is also unable to integrate due to the lack of operation inspection marketing data. Aiming at the performance problem of the visualization of topology data in the distribution network operation and inspection, this paper uses the graph data model to build knowledge, designs graphic elements for data migration, and forms a topology map for the intelligent operation and inspection of the distribution network. The research clearly and intuitively displays the specific information of the power system equipment and the physical relationship between the equipment, thus forming a data model of the grid diagram.

keywords: Exploratory modelling,Flexible design,Integrated modelling,Transition,Urban drainage,Urban water management
abstract: Long term planning of urban water infrastructure requires acknowledgement that transitions in the water system are driven by changes in the urban environment, as well as societal dynamics. Inherent to the complexity of these underlying processes is that the dynamics of a system's evolution cannot be explained by linear cause-effect relationships and cannot be predicted under narrow sets of assumptions. Planning therefore needs to consider the functional behaviour and performance of integrated flexible infrastructure systems under a wide range of future conditions. This paper presents the first step towards a new generation of integrated planning tools that take such an exploratory planning approach. The spatially explicit model, denoted DAnCE4Water, integrates urban development patterns, water infrastructure changes and the dynamics of socio-institutional changes. While the individual components of the DAnCE4Water model (i.e. modules for simulation of urban development, societal dynamics and evolution/performance of water infrastructure) have been developed elsewhere, this paper presents their integration into a single model. We explain the modelling framework of DAnCE4Water, its potential utility and its software implementation. The integrated model is validated for the case study of an urban catchment located in Melbourne, Australia.

abstract: A shortage of large power system data sets, as well as the frequent restrictions on sharing such models, have led to newfound interest in creating synthetic data that can be easily shared among researchers. This paper considers the problem of forming a power system test case from the constituent parts of realistic power grid samples. Starting from a topology, and samples of generation, load, and branches, we assemble systems while respecting the constraints imposed by a typical Optimal Power Flow problem. Expressed in this manner, the problem involves solving for permutations of the input data. Since permutations matrices are binary, the problem is linearized, allowing for a Mixed Integer Linear Problem formulation. The problem is further decomposed using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers as well as an Evolutionary Algorithm to facilitate scaling to larger system sizes. A post processing step is used to add shunt elements for reactive power planning. The resulting systems demonstrate statistically similar power flow behavior to reference systems. Finally, new analysis avenues, opened by synthesizing test cases according to the proposed method, are briefly introduced by creating fictitious systems with different topology models and examining how these affect power flow behavior.

abstract: Urban road networks are typical complex systems, which are crucial to our society and economy. In this study, topological characteristics of a number of urban road networks purely based on physical roads rather than routes of vehicles or buses are investigated in order to discover underlying unique structural features, particularly compared to other types of transport networks. Based on these topological indices, correlations between topological indices and small-worldness of urban road networks are also explored. The finding shows that there is no significant small-worldness for urban road networks, which is apparently different from other transport networks. Following this, community detection of urban road networks is conducted. The results reveal that communities and hierarchy of urban road networks tend to follow a general nature rule.

abstract: Cities need to build on their resilience to deal with the combined effects of urbanization, changing geopolitical contexts, and climate change. The physical form of cities has significant implications for their capacity to deal with adverse events and changing conditions. This paper focuses on streets as major constituent elements of urban form. It offers a review of the theoretical discussions and empirical evidence on how design and configuration of urban streets and street networks can contribute to/detract from urban resilience. For the purpose of this study, measures related to urban streets are divided into two broad categories: network topology and design and orientation. Network topology is used to represent urban street network as a combination of nodes and links. Relationships between urban resilience and different centrality and connectivity measures related to network topology are discussed. The design and orientation category explores the possible effects of street width, street edges, street canyon geometry, and street layout and orientation on resilience of cities. It is discussed that all topology and design measures have implications for urban resilience. Appropriate physical form of urban streets can contribute to urban resilience by, among other things, ameliorating urban microclimate, reducing energy consumption and its associated Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, enhancing social capital, improving community health and well-being, and facilitating rapid and effective emergency response in the aftermath of disasters. Overall, results provide insights about physical properties that are required to design resilient streets and street networks.

abstract: With the quick development of RFID technology and the decreasing prices of RFID devices, RFID is becoming widely used in various intelligent services. Especially in the retail application domain, RFID is increasingly adopted to capture the shopping tracks and behavior of in-store customers. To further enhance the potential of this promising application, in this paper, we propose a unified framework for RFID-based path analytics, which uses both in-store shopping paths and RFID-based purchasing data to mine actionable navigation patterns. Four modules of this framework are discussed, which are: (1) mapping from the physical space to the cyber space, (2) data preprocessing, (3) pattern mining and (4) knowledge understanding and utilization. In the data preprocessing module, the critical problem of how to capture the mainstream shopping path sequences while wiping out unnecessary redundant and repeated details is addressed in detail. To solve this problem, two types of redundant patterns, i.e., loop repeat pattern and palindrome-contained pattern are recognized and the corresponding processing algorithms are proposed. The experimental results show that the redundant pattern filtering functions are effective and scalable. Overall, this work builds a bridge between indoor positioning and advanced data mining technologies, and provides a feasible way to study customers' shopping behaviors via multi-source RFID data.

abstract: In applications such as social, energy, transportation, sensor, and neuronal networks, high-dimensional data naturally reside on the vertices of weighted graphs. The emerging field of signal processing on graphs merges algebraic and spectral graph theoretic concepts with computational harmonic analysis to process such signals on graphs. In this tutorial overview, we outline the main challenges of the area, discuss different ways to define graph spectral domains, which are the analogues to the classical frequency domain, and highlight the importance of incorporating the irregular structures of graph data domains when processing signals on graphs. We then review methods to generalize fundamental operations such as filtering, translation, modulation, dilation, and downsampling to the graph setting, and survey the localized, multiscale transforms that have been proposed to efficiently extract information from high-dimensional data on graphs. We conclude with a brief discussion of open issues and possible extensions.

abstract: We present a novel graph Transformer generative adversarial network (GTGAN) to learn effective graph node relations in an end-to-end fashion for the challenging graph-constrained house generation task. The proposed graph-Transformer-based generator includes a novel graph Transformer encoder that combines graph convolutions and self-attentions in a Transformer to model both local and global interactions across connected and non-connected graph nodes. Specifically, the proposed connected node attention (CNA) and non-connected node attention (NNA) aim to capture the global relations across connected nodes and non-connected nodes in the input graph, respectively. The proposed graph modeling block (GMB) aims to exploit local vertex interactions based on a house layout topology. Moreover, we propose a new node classification-based discriminator to preserve the high-level semantic and discriminative node features for different house components. Finally, we propose a novel graph-based cycle-consistency loss that aims at maintaining the relative spatial relationships between ground truth and predicted graphs. Experiments on two challenging graph-constrained house generation tasks (i.e., house layout and roof generation) with two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GTGAN in terms of objective quantitative scores and subjective visual realism. New state-of-the-art results are established by large margins on both tasks.

Title: Evaluation of Network Expansion Decisions for Resilient Interdependent Critical Infrastructures with Different Topologies

abstract: Resilient interdependent critical infrastructures (CIs) can better withstand cascading failures in disruptive events. This study proposes network expansion as a resilience improvement strategy for interdependent CIs and evaluates the influence of topology in interdependent network design for resilience optimization under disruption uncertainty. A resilience score consisting of network complexity and unmet demand metrics is introduced to quantify the resilience of expanded networks. Five synthetic interdependent network instances with random and hub-and-spoke (i.e., cluster) topologies are generated to represent CIs with heterogeneous node functions. Different network expansion opportunities are considered and critical node disruption scenarios are used to evaluate the impact of uncertain disruptions. We apply a two-stage stochastic multi-objective resilience optimization model to determine strategic investment decisions using the expected total cost and expected resilience score as competing objectives. Compromise solutions of expanded network designs are identified from Pareto optimal solutions and they are characterized according to their graph properties. The results show that expanded networks have improved resilience and the extent of improvement is affected by the network topology and type of disruption. Under critical node disruptions, a random network is more resilient than a hub-and-spoke structure due to its better connectivity. Characteristics of highly connected interdependent networks are high average node degree, high clustering coefficient, and low average shortest path length. Resilience improvement is more limited in expanded networks with a hub-and-spoke structure due to the negative impact of hub failures.

Title: {{PlanIT}}: Planning and Instantiating Indoor Scenes with Relation Graph and Spatial Prior Networks

abstract: We present a new framework for interior scene synthesis that combines a high-level relation graph representation with spatial prior neural networks. We observe that prior work on scene synthesis is divided into two camps: object-oriented approaches (which reason about the set of objects in a scene and their configurations) and space-oriented approaches (which reason about what objects occupy what regions of space). Our insight is that the object-oriented paradigm excels at high-level planning of how a room should be laid out, while the space-oriented paradigm performs well at instantiating a layout by placing objects in precise spatial configurations. With this in mind, we present PlanIT, a layout-generation framework that divides the problem into two distinct planning and instantiation phases. PlanIT represents the "plan" for a scene via a relation graph, encoding objects as nodes and spatial/semantic relationships between objects as edges. In the planning phase, it uses a deep graph convolutional generative model to synthesize relation graphs. In the instantiation phase, it uses image-based convolutional network modules to guide a search procedure that places objects into the scene in a manner consistent with the graph. By decomposing the problem in this way, PlanIT generates scenes of comparable quality to those generated by prior approaches (as judged by both people and learned classifiers), while also providing the modeling flexibility of the intermediate relationship graph representation. These graphs allow the system to support applications such as scene synthesis from a partial graph provided by a user.

abstract: Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators1,2,3,4, Josephson junction arrays5,6, excitable media7, neural networks8,9,10, spatial games11, genetic control networks12 and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks `rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them `small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.

abstract: Understanding a visual scene goes beyond recognizing individual objects in isolation. Relationships between objects also constitute rich semantic information about the scene. In this work, we explicitly model the objects and their relationships using scene graphs, a visually-grounded graphical structure of an image. We propose a novel end-to-end model that generates such structured scene representation from an input image. The model solves the scene graph inference problem using standard RNNs and learns to iteratively improves its predictions via message passing. Our joint inference model can take advantage of contextual cues to make better predictions on objects and their relationships. The experiments show that our model significantly outperforms previous methods for generating scene graphs using Visual Genome dataset and inferring support relations with NYU Depth v2 dataset.

abstract: Generating novel graph structures that optimize given objectives while obeying some given underlying rules is fundamental for chemistry, biology and social science research. This is especially important in the task of molecular graph generation, whose goal is to discover novel molecules with desired properties such as drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility, while obeying physical laws such as chemical valency. However, designing models to find molecules that optimize desired properties while incorporating highly complex and non-differentiable rules remains to be a challenging task. Here we propose Graph Convolutional Policy Network (GCPN), a general graph convolutional network based model for goal-directed graph generation through reinforcement learning. The model is trained to optimize domain-specific rewards and adversarial loss through policy gradient, and acts in an environment that incorporates domain-specific rules. Experimental results show that GCPN can achieve 61\% improvement on chemical property optimization over state-of-the-art baselines while resembling known molecules, and achieve 184\% improvement on the constrained property optimization task.

Title: A Customized Deep Learning Approach to Integrate Network-Scale Online Traffic Data Imputation and Prediction

abstract: Online data imputation and traffic prediction based on real-time data streams are essential for the intelligent transportation systems, particularly online navigation applications based on the real-time traffic information. However, the inevitable data missing problem caused by various disturbances undermines the information contained in such real-time data, thereby threatening the reliability of data acquisition as well as the prediction results. Such scenarios raise a strong need for integrating the tasks of network-scale online data imputation and traffic prediction, because the existing two-step approaches that separate the above procedures cannot be implemented in an online manner. In this paper, we propose a customized spatiotemporal deep learning architecture, named the graph convolutional bidirectional recurrent neural network (GCBRNN), to combine network-scale online data imputation and traffic prediction into an integrated task. The imputation mechanism and bidirectional framework are developed to cooperatively estimate missing entries and infer future values. We further design a network-scale graph convolutional gated recurrent unit (NGC-GRU) within the GCBRNN, which applies the graph convolution operation and 1{\texttimes}1 convolution module to capture the spatiotemporal dependencies in the traffic data. Experiments are carried out on two real-world traffic networks, including traffic speed and flow datasets. The comparison results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms several classical benchmark models with respect to both the imputation and prediction tasks on two datasets under various missing data rates.

abstract: Deep generative models for graphs have exhibited promising performance in ever-increasing domains such as design of molecules (i.e, graph of atoms) and structure prediction of proteins (i.e., graph of amino acids). Existing work typically focuses on static rather than dynamic graphs, which are actually very important in the applications such as protein folding, molecule reactions, and human mobility. Extending existing deep generative models from static to dynamic graphs is a challenging task, which requires to handle the factorization of static and dynamic characteristics as well as mutual interactions among node and edge patterns. Here, this paper proposes a novel framework of factorized deep generative models to achieve interpretable dynamic graph generation. Various generative models are proposed to characterize conditional independence among node, edge, static, and dynamic factors. Then, variational optimization strategies as well as dynamic graph decoders are proposed based on newly designed factorized variational autoencoders and recurrent graph deconvolutions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.

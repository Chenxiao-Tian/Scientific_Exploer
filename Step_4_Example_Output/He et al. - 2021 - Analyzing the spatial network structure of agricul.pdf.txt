Abstract
Investigating the regional correlation and factors affecting agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can help establish a
regionalmechanismforthesynergisticreductionofemissionsandproducechain-likereductions.Differentfromthetraditional
geographical relationship analysis framework, linear analysis ideas, we use social network analysis to discern the regional
correlations in agricultural GHG emissions from a relational network viewpoint, clarify the network functions of each node,
andexplainagriculturalGHGcorrelationfromaspatial,economic,andtechnologicalviewpointbynonparametricregression.

Yangtze River and the northwest,whiledependentorsare concentratedinmunicipalitiessuchasBeijingand Tianjin, and the

strategyaccordingtotheroleofeachregionandenhancingtheintermediator’s“conduit”rolewillultimatelyleadtotheformation

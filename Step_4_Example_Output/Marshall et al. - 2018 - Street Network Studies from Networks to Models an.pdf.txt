et al. 2013; Ducruet and Beauguitte 2014; Kivela¨ et al. 2014). However, as Butts
(2009: 416) has pointed out, ”To represent an empirical phenomenon as a network
isatheoreticalact(...)theappropriatechoiceofrepresentationiskeytogettingthe

The plurality of approaches is not always evident in the literature. For instance,

disciplinary precedents, unaware of, or unclear about, the diversity of approaches
available in other fields of urban research. As a result, they may reproduce past

well 1961; Kansky 1963; Garrison and Marble 1962; Haggett and Chorley 1969;
Barthelemy 2011). A given network is generally considered to be an assembly of
elements and their relations, a transport network is a spatial network of connected

onlinearpathsformovementfromAtoB andthecostsassociatedwiththismove-
ment (i.e. time, energy, financial). In the most typical conceptualisation as a graph,
nodes in a transport network typically represent settlements (such as whole cities,
regions or any other kind of origin or destination), individual loci of connection or
access (interchanges, junctions, stations) or any other point of transition or termi-
nation (including culs-de-sac, network boundary points). Links represent the paths
of movement (whether fixed and enduring physical infrastructure or periodic paths
throughtheairorwater)betweenthosenodes.

2.2 TheMultifacetedNatureofStreetNetworks
A road is a physically constructed or demarcated path or channel to accommodate
flows of people and vehicles. The connectivity of the road network is assured by
junctions,nodeswheresomeeventmightoccur:achangeofdirection,orconflictsof

for human behaviour; the people and activities that exist there, and their social and
economic interactions are important characteristics. The physical characteristics of
streets are not limited to linear length and width, and movement can exist in a 2D
field of the street surface not confined to its medial axis (Hahmann et al. 2018). It
can also be influenced by the 3D nature of the street profile or the vistas the street
affords.Thisisparticularlytruewhendealingwithpedestrians,forwhomastreethas

2.4 AlternativeApproachestoModellingStreets
Astreetorroadcanbeseenasanaggregationofstreetsegments(henceacompos-
ite,or‘secondorder’element;Courtatetal.2011;Figueiredo2015a);itcanequally
beconsideredanintegralspatialwholethatisfragmentedintosuccessivestreetseg-
ments or axial lines, or other finer scale elements. From this latter perspective, a
street or road is the primary element. The key question then is how to identify and
distinguishindividualstreetsorstreet-likeelements.
Several alternative methods have been developed to address this question, with
a wide application to urban morphological and movement studies in academia
and practice worldwide. The space syntax community pioneered this approach by
introducing models based on axial lines (Hillier and Hanson 1984), which can be
interpreted as street-like elements (Hillier et al. 1993). Later, models based on line
or street segments became increasingly prominent, not least because of a broad
availabilityofdata(Turner2007;Peponisetal.2008).
Inparallel,othermethodsofmodellingthecontinuityofstreetshavebeendevel-
oped and applied to empirical studies. Approaches that capture the route structure,
using the route as a primary element (Marshall2005; Kropf 2008); that distinguish
streets by name (Jiang and Claramunt 2004a, b); or that create street-like elements
based on the angular continuity of either axial lines or street segments: strokes
(ThomsonandRichardson1999),continuitylines(FigueiredoandAmorim2005b),
intersection continuity negotiation (ICN) (Porta et al. 2006a), natural roads (Jiang
etal.2008;Tomkoetal.2008).(Thesetechniquesarequitesimilarandalwayschoose
the ”best continuation” (least angle). However, continuity lines and natural streets
alsoadoptanangularthresholdabovewhichstreetsegmentsorlinesarenotaggre-
gated.) A further representational approach is that of the line structure – composed
ofcontinuouslinesandpoints–mathematicallycomparablewithanincidencestruc-
ture, and interpretable as having a degree of abstraction between network models
and graphs (Marshall 2016). Each approach is a particular interpretation of a street
networkandhasparticularpurposes,advantagesandlimitations(Fig.1).

other is so direct and intuitive. However, since any graph could be interpreted as a
’node-link’ representation, we propose to call this (Fig. 1, f) thejunction graph, in
effectadoptingtheconventionthatthetypeofgraphisnamedaftertheentityprimar-

AsisclearfromFig.1,agraphrepresentationneednotequatethelinearpathsof

selves as the primary elements of study, and represent those as vertices in a graph,
whiletheconnectionsbetweenstreets(i.e.junctionsorintersections)becomeedges
in the corresponding graph. This representation (Batty 2004a, b), can be seen as
equally logical and intuitive from its own point of view (Marshall 2016). In trans-
portation,agraphwherethestreetsegmentisthevertexandthejunctionsareedges
has been used to include turn costs and restrictions in the model (Caldwell 1961;
Winter2002).Thiscanbereferredtoasthestreet-segmentgraph(Fig.1,h).
Similarly,astreetnetworkcouldberepresentedbyanaxialmap(comprisingaxial
lines, Fig. 1, i) (Hillier and Hanson 1984), and analyses carried out in which those
axial lines are represented by the vertices in the graph,while intersectionsbetween
axial lines are represented by edges (Fig. 1, j). Each other kind of network model
discussedherehasacorrespondinggraph(Fig.1,k–p).
Whenusinganodeandlinkstreet networkmodel,onecanextractweightsfrom
the geometry of the network and assign them to the edges of the graph. In the case
of the conventional junction graph, this weight is typically the length of the links.
Inthecaseofthestreetsegmentsgraph,thisweightcanbetheangulardeviationof
the streets incident in a junction, or the sum of half the length of each link (Winter
2002).Usingtheseweightedgraphsofstreetsegmentsasverticesitispossibletogen-
erate a range of alternative non-planar graph representations (Gil 2014; Figueiredo
2015a; Stavroulaki et al. 2017; Tomko et al. 2008) that correspond to continuous
streetnetworkmodels.
3.2 ANoteonTerminology
The dominant representation of street network models as graphs (links as edges,
nodes as vertices) has been widely referred to as the primal representation (Porta
et al. 2006b), while the alternative (aggregated streets as vertices, intersections as
edges)hasbeenreferredtoasthedualgraphofthestreetnetworkmodel(Portaetal.
2006a).Thisterminologyisnotonlyinconsistentlyusedintheliteraturebecausethe

This duality may be perceived between the planar junctions graphs of the node
and link street network model (junctions as vertices, streets as links) and the urban
block adjacency graph defined by the streets segments as boundaries of polygonal

4 CreatingandAnalysingStreetNetworkModels
4.1 CreatingStreetNetworkModels
The creation of a street network model requires the choice of a data set to support
itsrepresentation,butthereversecanalsooccur:theavailabilityofastreetnetwork
datasetsuggeststhechoiceofaspecificstreetnetworkmodel.Thewidelyavailable
road centre line (RCL) data sets offer a specific representation of street segments
between intersections (Fig. 1 top row, a-d), thus are directly usable for node-link
models, and for junctionsor street segment graphs(Fig. 1 row2,e-h). Other levels
ofrepresentationcanbederivedfromsuchdata,e.g.longcurvilinearstreetsegments
can be broken into individual line segments (Stavroulaki et al. 2017) or axial lines
(Fig.1i),orcontiguousstreet segmentscan beaggregated intoalternativecontinu-
ous street representations (Fig. 1 k, m, o). However, while RCL are common, they
should not be used without rigorous attention and preparation. They often contain

errors,wheretheprincipleofinterruptingstreetsegmentsatintersectionsisnotkept.
Theycanalsoincludenumerousroadinfrastructureartefactssuchastrafficislands,

leadtodistinctanalyticalconclusions.Whilegeneraliseddatasetssimplifythestreet

roadsthatareofparticularinteresttostreetnetworkstudies.
Insomestreetnetworkapproachesthestreetnetworkisdrawnmanuallytoachieve
specific representations of continuity (e.g., the axial map, Fig. 1, i). This approach
isoftenconsideredsubjectiveandlaborious,limitingthereproducibilityandspatial
extent of the research. Nevertheless the researcher can choose the level of rep-
resentation and what to include in the model as required by the purpose of the
research.
4.2 AnalysingStreetNetworkModels
Ultimately,whateverthestreetnetworkmodeladopted,agraphiscreatedconsisting
of vertices and edges, eventually with some kind of weights (Table 1). This graph
canthenbeanalysedindifferentwaysdependingonthepurposeofthestudy.Differ-
entanalyticmethodshavebeenused,stemmingfromdifferentdisciplines–transport
networkanalysis,networkcentrality,geographicaccessibility,andtypologicalclas-
sification.Someexamplesofwhatthesemethodsrepresentandhowtheyareapplied
todifferentstreetnetworkgraphsarenowsuggestedforillustration.
Traversal Transport network analysis includes traversal problems, such as single
journeyrouting(e.g.,Caldwell1961),serviceareacalculation(e.g.,OkabeandKita-
mura 1996; Peponis et al. 2008), origin destination matrix calculation, and other
route optimisation algorithms such as the travelling salesman problem. These anal-
yses use the network as a means to get from A to B without measuring properties
ofthenetworkelementsthemselves.Theyarethereforeverymuchalignedwiththe
transportnetworkrepresentation,andworkbestwithdisaggregaterepresentationsof
streetnetworksbecausetheyrelyonindividualroutesandpathsmeanderingthrough

Globalimportanceofnetworkelements Networkcentrality,ontheotherhand,con-
sists of a collection of algorithms from network science, such as degree, closeness,
betweenness, or eigenvector centrality, that give a measure to every vertex in the
graph(Newman2003;Crucittietal.2006).Theseareindicatorsoftherelativeimpor-
tance of graph vertices, as the number of connections (degree) to other vertices, or
being close (lower average distance) to all others, or between (frequently on short-
estroutes)allothers.Thesemetricsareanintrinsicpropertyofthenetworkasobject

StreetNetworkStudies:FromNetworkstoModels... 745
streetnetworkrepresentation,aslongasitmeetsrequiredmathematicalcriteria,such
ashavingasingleconnectedcomponentoraminimummeaningfulsize.Theresults
and their interpretation are obviously sensitive to the modelling approach adopted
(Gil2017).
Networksubgraphs A number of network measures can be calculated as the value
of a location on the network in relation to opportunities within a cut-off distance
or threshold, based on metric (e.g., Porta et al. 2006b) or topological (e.g., Hillier
andHanson1984)distances,time,budget,quantity,sizeorperceivedutility.Theyare
similartoglobalmeasuresexceptthatthecut-offorthresholdrulecreateasubgraph
for each node in the system. In some cases they may include other features of the
urbanenvironmentthatarenotpartofthestreetnetwork,e.g.landuse(Sta˚hleetal.
2005;SevtsukandMekonnen2012).Aswithsimplertransportnetworkanalysis,this
type of indicator is most suited for disaggregate representations of street networks,
andrequiresadiversityofweightsandadditionaldatasets(Miller1999;Okabeand
Kitamura 1996). However, it can also be performed in aggregated representations,
suchastheaxialmap,aloneorcombinedwithplots(Sta˚hleetal.2005).
Typologicalanalysis Finally,othernetworkstudiesusetheresultingmodeltoiden-
tify typological characteristics of the different elements, streets or junctions. For
thispurposearangeoftechniquesareused, suchasbased ontheroutestructureor
geometric characteristics of the network elements (sinuosity of the streets, angles
between links in junctions) for use in morphological analyses, street layout design
or conservation planning, e.g. Marshall (2005), Kropf (2017), and Thomson and
Richardson(1999).
Itshouldbestressedthatinprincipleeverytypeofanalysiscouldbemadeusing
every graph, but some are more meaningful than others. The more disaggregated
representations, consisting of individual street elements such as junctions and seg-
ments, are perceived as providinga greater level of detail in the analysis, while the
more aggregated models, combining street elements based on different notions of
continuity,providedifferenttypesofstructuralpropertiesandaremostlysuitablefor
topologicalanalysisofglobalpatternsofcentrality.

Treating a street system as a network is of itself a commitment to a paradigm, a
modellingdecisionthatinfluenceshowthatstreetsystemisanalysed,valuedandulti-
matelydesignedormanaged.Thereisarangeofmodelsofstreetnetworkstructures
(Fig. 1), providing alternatives to the conventional model with junctions as nodes
andstreetsegmentsaslinks.Inturn,thesemodelsmaybedifferentlyrepresentedas
graphs (Table 1), which lend themselves to analyses for traversal, connectivity,and
centrality.Theseanalysesinturnrevealarangeoflocalorglobalpropertiesofindi-
vidualstreetsorjunctions,theiraggregationsincludingroutes,orhelpunderstandthe
statisticalpropertiesofthewholestreetnetwork.
While different traditions have established preferences when studying networks,
weconsideritvaluablethatdifferentdisciplinescanlearnfromeachother,andthat
all those traditions can consider the approaches noted in this article. We hope this
will allow for a more informed, purposeful selectivity in street system modelling
carved from this plurality of choices. Some models benefit from the simple and
directderivationfromcommondatasources(RCL)usingmainstreamsoftwaretools
andconsequentlyaredominantinthescholarshiptraditionofnetworkscience.Yet,
street networks in particular require a wider and more nuanced range of analytical
approachestocapturethecomplexaspectsofstreetenvironmentsandnotpurelytheir

Asawayforward,weargueforamoreunifiedandcomprehensiveattitudetostreet

Second, we encourage theoretical consolidation of the field, with more detailed
comparativetheoreticalanalysesofthesemodelsandanalyticalapproaches,includ-
ing how they relate to each other and to other traditions in science that study
networks. This paper can be considered a start, but broader and deeper studies are
suggested, that could clarify the relationships between the different kinds of street

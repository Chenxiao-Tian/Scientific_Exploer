spaces, and geographical scales all impose impacts on the results. For example,
the scale-free structure is very common for urban public transport systems in the
L-space representation, but almost ruled out for those in the P-space. These com-
parisons and summarizations provide meaningful inspiration for planners on the
transportationsystemdesignandoptimization.
Complexnetworktheoryhasundergonerapiddevelopmentsinthelastdecade;
much work lies ahead in this field. There is still a long way to go to apply all
achievements in transport practice. First, exploring network cellular structures
is of utmost importance to understanding the planarity of grounded transpor-
tation systems and coping with modern traffic dilemmas. More geographic con-
straints and urban attributes, such as population density distribution and
land-use structures, should be considered for general contexts. Second, with the
availability of GPS and various mobile devices, recognizing and tracking
human mobility patterns is becoming a hot issue in many research areas.
Undoubtedly, exploring the relationship between the underlying topological
structure of transportation systems and human movements on them is much
more challenging, demanding that transport researchers have a good capacity
to handle gigantic amounts of data. Admittedly, many studies reviewed in this
article are still in the theoretical stage. More efforts should be made to explore
potential applications and meanings for practical transport planning, especially
when different characteristics for different transport systems are considered.
Much progress can be expected with morecollaboration among different subject
areas in thefuture.

1. Introduction
Complex network theory is a science that studies the connection and interaction
between components in a system. It is an emerging field, developing at a rapid
pace. Particularly in the last decade, the proposing of small-world and scale-
free models has brought about comprehensive research and interest on this
subject from different disciplines, which shows that the structures of networks
existing in various domains are more similar than one would have expected.
Transportationsystems,whichtaketheformofnetworks,havebeenahotresearch
topic in complex network studies. A great deal of progress has been made in
various disciplines, including physics, sociology, transport geography — not to
mentiontheresearchobjectsrangingfromgroundedpublictransportationtomar-
itime systems to aviation systems and so forth. In this case, bridging the gaps
among different perspectives and constructing an overall understanding of
complex transport networks, especially with the availability of gigantic data
sets on large transport systems, becomes the foremost challenge for transport
researchers,andthemotivationforthisarticle.Totheseends,theauthorssystem-

detailed structureof thisarticle will be explained in Section 1.2.
1.1 Network Analysisin Early Transport Studies
Networkanalysisisacommonandeffectiveapproach,consideringitselegancein
reflecting spatial structures, to study river systems, channel patterns, and road
networks (Haggett & Chorley, 1969). Many elementary topological measures are
familiar to researchers, who divided networks, in terms of the topology, into
branchingnetworks,circuitnetworks,barriernetworks,andthelike.Thehistori-
cal notable Ko¨nigsberg’s Bridges Problem, solved by Euler in 1735, can be
regarded as a simplified and the earliest transportation optimization. It not only

century, network analysis also became a core concept in transportation studies
(Black,2003).Itdevelopedatopologicalandmathematicexplanationfortransport
systems. Furthermore, the network data model is considered the most efficient
way to extract and reference transport systems in a computer (geographic infor-
mation system) environment. A set of indicators is developed to quantify trans-
port networks, for example, connectivity, cyclomatic number, diameter, and
accessibility (Rodrigue, Comtois, & Slack, 2009). Some of them are analogical to
measures in complex network theory. Although many efforts have been made

1.2 Aim and StructureofthisArticle
The primary aim of this article is to offer a comprehensive review of topological
representations, measures, and case studies of transport systems from a
complex network perspective. However, it is worth mentioning that the authors
not only summarize these works simply,but also comparevarious definitions in

sis should be shed on the practical significance of this review work. Network

to identify critical nodes and links in a system, which can provide necessary
warning for potential attacks orfaults. Moreover,human behaviors aretoo com-
plicated to be fully captured. Fortunately, they are affected to a large extent by

tive is the first step to identify human movement patterns, and will contribute
greatly to solving modern traffic problems, including congestion, navigation,

2. Representation ofTransport Systems
2.1 Basic Network Representation
According to graph theory (Diestel, 2005), the basic representation of a
network can be generalized as G ¼(N, E), which means that it is composed
of a node (vertex) set N and an edge (link) set E (Figure 1(a)). Besides, in
order to store and calculate a network in a computer environment much
more easily, the adjacent matrix is introduced (Figure 1(b)). For an n-node
∗
network, its adjacent matrix would be an n n matrix. If there is an edge
between two nodes, then the entry element in the matrix equals to 1; other-
wise it is 0.
A directed network can be defined by differentiating the direction of a link
(Figure 1(a)). Moreover, if the different importances of edges in the network are
considered, a weighted network will be generated. In this sense, an unweighted
network can be regarded as a special case when every link presents the same
importance.
2.2 Representationof Non-Planar TransportationNetworks
First,weshallclarifytwoconcepts:planarandnon-planargraphs.Astheirnames
imply,planargraphsareembeddedintheEuclideanspace,andtheiredgesnever
intersect with each other if there is no channel or bridge (Wilson, 2010). On the
contrary, the edges of non-planar graphs can meet each other without forming a
node within aplane.
In contrast to other ground transportation systems, aviation networks and
maritime transport networks present more non-planar characteristics. They
possess a relatively straightforward representation by taking stops as nodes
and the routes between them as links. The directed and weighted networks
can be obtained by considering the directions and differences of routes. It is
worth noting that because of the existence of intersections between links, the
degrees in non-planar networks could be much bigger than those in planar net-
works.

2.3 Representation of Urban Road Networks
Urban streets and roads constitute the skeleton of a city, and therefore play a
crucial role in shaping the configuration of urban forms. Street networks are
typical spatial planar graphs and also are a crucial subject to researchers on
space syntax. Typically, there are two common ways to extract planar networks:
the primal approach and the dual representation. The primal representation is a
naturalandintuitionalapproach,takingroutesegmentsaslinks,andintersections
orendsofthemasnodes(Crucitti,Latora,&Porta,2006;Porta,Crucitti,&Latora,
2006b;Scellato,Cardillo,Latora,&Porta,2006).Thismethodretainsthegeometric
patterns and geographical properties of transportation systems. It is this reason
that makes the primal approach the acknowledged data model for geo-spatial
data sets andcomputer simulation.
After Hiller and Hanson (1984) introduced the topological perspective into
space syntax in the mid-1980s, the dual representation of spaces came into our
sights (Batty, 2004; Jiang & Claramunt, 2002). This approach focuses on the top-
ology of transportation networks by taking roads or routes as vertices and inter-
sections as links (Jiang, 2007; Porta, Crucitti, & Latora, 2006a). In this sense, it
reflects the functional structure of networks, whereas the Euclidean coordinates
of nodes and spatial distances of edges are neglected. This representation offers
a higher degree of abstraction and presents a better picture of road hierarchy.
Therefore, it is conducive to navigation in street networks. Walkers can get a
local connectivity graph even in a very long street, but unfortunately it could
notguaranteetheoptimaloptionbecauseoftheabsenceofdistanceinformation.
Toavoidthis shortcoming, researchers (Hu,Jiang, Wang,&Wu,2009; Hu,Jiang,
Wu,Wang,&Wu,2008;Zeng,Guo,Zhu,Mitrovic,&Tadic,2009)introducedthe
holding capacity and turning ability to combine the motion and navigation in a
dualgraph.Itisfoundthatawell-plannedlatticeroadnetworkismuchmoreeffi-

Intheprocessofconstructingadualnetwork,theimplicationofnodes—thatis,
thealignmentofroadsegments—isakeyfactortosubsequentanalysis.Jiangand
Claramunt (2004) considered named streets as vertices (Kalapala, Sanwalani,
Clauset, & Moore, 2006) (Figure 2(b)). However, Porta et al. (2006a) argued that
this method would introduce some subjectivity into the analysis; instead they
used the intersection continuity negotiation (ICN) model by examining the
good continuation among all pairs of incident edges in the street networks
(Figure2).Somefurtherimprovementsaremadebasedonthesetwoapproaches
by considering the deflecting angle (Masucci, Smith, Crooks, & Batty, 2009) and
different join principles in terms of every-best-fit, self-best-fit, and self-fit to
connect neighboring segments (Jiang, Yin, & Zhao, 2009). Different methods
may generate different strategies for searchingfor theshortest path length.

2004),althoughtheyseemcontradictorybecauseofoppositegeneralizationrules.
Notethatthedualmodelhereisnotthedualofplanargraphs,whichtakesfaces
as vertices, but shares some similarities with the linear dual of planar graphs
(Anez, de la Barra, & Perez, 1996; Barthelemy, 2011). In transport practice, a
dual graph can easily represent various operators, for example, turning restric-
tions and multiple transit routes. Therefore it can reduce the complexity and
time for transport computation, including shortest path search, capacity,

2.4 Representationof Public Transport Systems
In general, public transportation systems consist of metro, bus, or railway net-
works and so on. These systems comprise a set of routes with distributed stops
or stations. With the availability of databases of real networks and rapidly
growingcomputercapacity,moreandmoreeffortshavebeenmadetounderstand
public transport systems because of their importance to ourdaily lives.Progress
has been obtained in representing them in distinct L-space and P-space (Ferber,
Holovatch, Holovatch, & Palchykov, 2007; Sienkiewicz & Holyst, 2005; Xu, Hu,
Liu,&Liu,2007b),anddifferenttopologicalcharacteristicsgeneratedbyrepresen-
tations alsoare discussed.
L-space depicts the original configuration of real-life transport networks, in
which stops or stations are vertices. Two vertices are connected if they are con-
secutive on an arbitrary route (Figure 3(b)) (Sienkiewicz & Holyst, 2005; Wang,
Complex Network Topology 663
Figure3. (a)Twosimplifiedpublicbusroutesandtherepresentationsin(b)L-spaceand(c)P-space.
Jiang, Wu, Wang, & Wu, 2008). Sometimes it could be referred to as the space of
stopsor space ofstations (Kurant & Thiran, 2006).
In comparison, Sen et al. (2003) introduced P-space as a new representation
pattern. All of the stops of a route can be connected because a directed line can
bedetectedbetweenoneanother;thatistosay,ifthereisatleastonelineconnect-
ingtwonodes,thenalinkwillbeconstructedbetweenthem.Consequently,afully

asnodes(Figure3(c)).Inthissense,thepathlengthbetweentwonodesindicates
the required transfer times during travel, so that the P-space is also called the
spaceoftransfer(Kurant&Thiran,2006).Forexample,inFigure3(c),passengers

many stops between them.
Additionally, the bipartite viewpoint also is introduced by mapping vehicles
andstationsastwosetsofvertices,andavehiclecanbeconnectedtoallstations
it passes through. This method is useful in analyzing cooperation transport net-
works (Ferber, Holovatch, Holovatch, & Palchykov, 2009; Seaton & Hackett,
2004). With such a representation, the underlying physical infrastructure and
trafficflowsarestudiedseparately,whilebothroutesandstationsareconsidered
as nodes (Latora & Marchiori, 2002; Wang, Hu, Wu, & Niu, 2009). Derrible and
Kennedy (2009) recently introduced another approach by considering several
types of vertices and planarity. More details can be found in their series of
studies(Derrible & Kennedy,2010a,2010b).
3. Basic Measures
3.1 Node Centrality
Centrality is afundamental conceptfor network topological analysis. Itwasfirst
proposedinsociology(Freeman,1977,1979)andquicklyadoptedbyawiderange
of otherdisciplines.
3.1.1 Degree. Nodedegreeisthemoststraightforwardindextoquantifytheindi-
vidual centrality. It is believed that the most important node must be the most
active one, so degree indicates the number of edges connected to a node, which
is definedbased on an adjacent matrix as
(cid:2)
k = a , (1)
i ij
j[V
664 J. Linand Y.Ban
Vrepresentstheneighborsetofnodei,anda istheentryvalueintheadjacent
ij
matrix. In essence, node degree equals the connectivity in space syntax. If a
directed network is considered, then the degree can be extended to in-degree
and out-degree, which respectively calculate the number of links ending in or
starting fromthenode. They arewritten as
(cid:2)
ki = a , (2)
ji
in
j[V
(cid:2)
ki = a . (3)
out ij
j[V
The well-known scale-free network is based on the degree definitions. If the
degree of a graph follows a power-law distribution — that is, p(k)/1/km —
then it can be generalized as scale-free (Baraba´si & Albert, 1999). It indicates
that there is a huge heterogeneity in the network; a few nodes are highly con-
nected hubs, whereas most of the rest are very poorly connected. This pattern
imposes important consequences for dynamic processes on transport networks;
therefore,ithas attracted much attention since itwasproposed.
3.1.2 Betweenness centrality. Betweenness quantifies the level of intermediate
importance of a node in the interaction between other nodes (Freeman, 1977,
1979)(Figure4(1)). The node betweenness can be defined as
(cid:2)
n (i)
CB = jg , (4)
i n
j=g jg
where n (i) is thenumberof theshortest paths between nodej and g,which are
jg
passing through node i, while n is the number of all shortest paths between
jg
them. Analogically, edge betweenness can be obtained, which is useful to detect
the community structure of networks (Scellato et al., 2006). It is worth noting
that in real transportation systems, these nodes with a high betweenness would
impose critical impacts onnetwork security (Barthelemy,2004)
3.1.3 Closenesscentrality. Asthenameshows,closenesscentralitycalculateshow
far itis from agiven node to all other nodes ina network (Figure4(2)).

fornavigatingtransportnetworks.Itintroducesthespatialdistanceandpresents
to what extent the shortest path between node pairs in the network deviates

3.1.5 Weight and Strength. Most real networks present a high degree of hetero-
geneity in the intensity of communications (Boccaletti, Latora, Moreno, Chavez,
&Hwang,2006).Asasupplement,edgeweightwasproposedtomeasurethecen-

Weighted networks provide a good description and explanation for the rich

Given a weighted network, the clustering coefficient should be rewritten as

holds, then these edges with larger weights in the graph are more likely to form

interconnected triplets. This phenomenon is called rich-club. In the opposite,
cw ,c indicates these larger-weight edges are not included in interconnected
i i
triplets.
3.2.2 Degree-degree correlation. Another quantity used to probe the networks’
localarchitectureis the average degree ofnearestneighbors, k (i):

this tendency is regarded as assortativity;otherwise, disassortativity is detected.
3.3 Global Network Measures
3.3.1 Characteristic path length. Characteristic path length is a global property
important to the communication in networks. It reflects the internal structure of
a network by containing theinternal separations of all node pairs.

traryvertices inthenetwork(Boccalettietal.,2006).Foranon-valued graph,the
distanceequalsthegeodesiclength.However,itconfrontsthedivergenceproblem
for non-connected graphs.
In particular, a small-world network can be characterized by a big clustering
coefficient and short average path length (Watts & Strogatz, 1998). That is to
say, any randomly selected nodes can be reachable by a small number of hops
despite the large size of the network. A small-world network bridges the
random network, which presents a short path length, and the regular network
with a high clustering extent. Therefore, it has been acknowledged as one of the
most important propertiesofnetworks andhasbeenverified bymanyempirical
studies, including social, technological, information, and biological networks
(Newman, 2003).
3.3.2 Efficiency. Latora and Marchiori (2001) proposed an index to measure the
performanceoftheinformationexchangeofnetworksbyassumingthatthecom-
munication efficiency inside a network depends on the shortest path length
between node pairs. In this case, the efficiency is estimated as
(cid:2)
1 1
E= . (15)
N(N−1) d
i=j ij
It is calculated from the inverse of path distance between nodes, therefore
avoiding the meaningless definition in non-connected graphs. Furthermore, it
can be divided into global efficiency when all nodes in the network are con-
668 J. Linand Y.Ban
sidered and local efficiency when taking the average of efficiency values of sub-
graphs.
However, for congested transport networks, passengers will select their
routes in terms of real-time flows and cost; therefore, another efficiency
measure was proposed in the context of network equilibrium (Nagurney &
Qiang, 2007). Given the set of origin/destination (O/D) pairs R, including the
N O/D routes in the network, and the real-time demand on an O/D route f,
r r
theefficiency is
(cid:3)
E′ = r[R f r/h r, (16)
N
r
where h is the equilibrium disutility, representing the minimum equilibrium
r
travel cost of the route. This measure does not count routes without associated
demand and it can be extended in continuous time and discrete time versions
(Nagurney & Qiang, 2008). It offers meaningful implications to evaluate the
robustness of congested networks. On the other hand, it has a high requirement
for evolutionary traffic data, so has not been discussed widely in empirical
analysis.
3.3.3 Information centrality. Based on their network efficiency definition, Latora
and Marchiori (2007) proposed information centrality, which also occurred in a
series of subsequent analyses conducted by their research group (Crucitti et al.,
2006; Porta et al., 2006a, 2006b). It is quantified by the relative difference of
network efficiency caused by removingnode ifromgraph g.
E(g)−E(g′
)
CI = . (17)
i E(g)
′
Here, g corresponds to the network after deleting node i and its incident edges.
Analogously, it also can be applied to a group of points or an edge (Scellato
etal.,2006).Informationcentralitycanhelpusdistinguishthosecriticalintersec-

Actually, early in the 1960s, a series of indices for transport network analysis
was developed (Garrisoon & Marble, 1962; Kansky, 1963). The alpha index (a),

3.4.2 Planarity. Furthermore, researchers have also developed many other
measures to reveal thoroughly topological structures of real planar networks.
For example, Xie and Levinson (2007, 2009) proposed treeness and circuitness
in terms of two different connection patterns of road networks. The treeness is
definedas
L
f = t , (22)

g
whereL isthelengthoflinksinthepartofthetreestructureandL isthetotal

length of all segments in the network. Then the circuitness is equal to
f =1−f . More detailed works about eta index, theta index, ringness,
circuit tree
webness, beltness, etc. can be found in studies by Levinson (Levinson, 2012; Xie
& Levinson,2007, 2009,2011).

emy & Flammini, 2008; Chan, Donner, & La¨mmer, 2011). Furthermore, consider-

4. Empirical Analysis
4.1 Railway Networks
Fromthissection,thefocuswillbeshiftedfromtheoreticalfoundationstoempiri-
calanalyses.Railwaysystemsareanimportantpartofnationalinfrastructureand
play a critical role in inter-city commuting. However, a railway system usually
covers a huge areaand involves a large number of stations and routes, so that it
is very difficult to collect high-quality research data. It is for this reason that
there have not been many studies on real railway networks.
Senetal.(2003)firstexploredthestructureoftheIndianrailwaynetworkbased
onacomplexnetworkperspective.TheyconstructthenetworkinP-spacebyiden-
tifyingstationsasnodesandatrainthatstopsatanytwostationsaslinks.Based
onthis,thesmall-worldeffectandanexponentialdegreedistributionaredetected.
The same result is also observed from the Japanese railway network around
Tokyo Metropolitan, based on the P-space representation (Majima, Katuhara, &
Takadama,2007).
In comparison, the Chinese railway network, a much larger data set including
3915 stations and 22,259 railways, exhibits power-law distributions on both
degreeandstrength(Li&Cai,2007),andasmall-worldproperty.Disassortativity
is also detected when the correlations between different measures are explored
(Figure 5(a)). From a totally different perspective, Guo and Cai (2008) extracted
China’s railway network in the L-space and considered the utilized efficiency of
stations as a new weight measurement. Consequently, they concluded that
China’srailwaynetworkisanassortativescale-freenetwork(Figure5(b)).Further-

p(x)=a(x+b)a. (24)
It is worth noting that in the three works about the weighted Chinese railway
network, they all detected the correlation between node strength and degree as
ascaling relation(Table 1).
To separate the underlying infrastructure and surface traffic flows in railway
systems, a multi-layer viewpoint is also introduced. Kurant and Thiran (2006)
created two layers of undirected physical graph Gf and the logic graph Gl for
three railway systems, and they found a very weak correlation between degree
kf and real load l or the betweenness bf and l. In the studies of Wang, Zhou,
Shi, Wang, He (2009), stations and trains are considered separate layers, and a
train is connected to all stations where it stops. Comparatively, Zou, Zhou, Liu,
Xu, and He (2010) take the L-space and P-space representations of China’s
railway system as two layers. They insist that the two layers reflect different
aspects of transportation systems and that combining them is helpful to under-
standthe“networkofnetworks”.Finally,theyconcludethatdegreeorclustering
coefficient intwo layers both display high correlations.

4.2 Urban Public Transport Networks
4.2.1 Centrality. In general, the scale-free structure is very common for urban
public transport systems in the space of L (Ferber et al., 2007), but almost ruled
out for the space of P. The reason for this phenomenon is that connections
between stations are highly correlated in L-space, whereas the routes are linked
nearly randomly in P-space. Only Ferber et al. (2007, 2009) reported three
exceptions — London, Paris, and Los Angeles — of which the routes are
evolved inacorrelatedwayduring theirevolution process.
Betweennesscouldbeconsideredanotherindicationofthetopologicalcentral-
ityfortransportsystems.Researchers(Sienkiewicz&Holyst,2005)comparedthe
betweenness of 22 Polish public transport networks in different spaces. The
scaling relation between betweenness and degree can be detected in L-space,

in Section 2.3 into considerations. It is also consistent with the results of Roth,
Kang, Batty, and Barthelemy (2012), in which they studied the 14 largest metro
systems in the world. But they take it a further step forward by mixing spatial
andtopological propertiesinan evolution perspective.
A rich-club phenomenon, which means edges with a higher weight are more
likely to be clustered, can be detected by comparing the topological clustering
coefficient and the weighted clustering coefficient (Montis, Barthelemy, Chessa,
&Vespignani,2007;Sohetal.,2010).Thatistosay,iftheweightedclusteringcoef-
ficient is larger than the topological one, the interconnected groups in the traffic
network areformed morelikely by routeswith high traffics, and vice versa.
4.2.3 Weightandstrength. Inadditiontotheabove-mentionedtopologicalcharac-
teristics, dynamic traffic flows usually are considered the weight between two
stations in weighted public transport systems. Soh et al. (2010) even noticed the
divergences of traffic flows between weekdays and the weekend by adopting a
moredetailed database.
In L-space, Lee, Jung, Park, and Chio (2008) found that distributions of the
weight and strength of Seoul subway system exhibit totally different trends.

distribution, whereas the strength might display two-regime power laws with
differentexponents,whichisalsocalledthedoubleParetolaw(Xuetal.,2007b).
Although there is a positive correlation between the degree and the
strength (Figure 6(a)), they, respectively, possess different distribution patterns
676 J. Linand Y.Ban
(Figure 6(b)). The strength distribution in P-space always conforms to a power-
law distribution, in contrast to the exponential trend of degree. Therefore,
althoughtheconnectionbetweennodesmaybeconstructedrandomly,themagni-
tudes ofthe travel flows are not.
4.2.4 Efficiency. Fromtheinitialstage,researchershaverealizedthattheultimate
aim of studying public transport systems is to improve the efficiency of travels
and optimize underlying structures. The Boston subway system is considered to
achieve 63% of the global efficiency of the ideal subway, whereas the local effi-
ciency is only 3%. This result implies that the network has a low degree of fault
tolerance (Latora & Marchiori, 2002). However, Lee et al. (2008) held that
network efficiency should be calculated based on physical distance rather than
on network distance because realistic networks could not have all-to-all connec-
tions between stations or stops. In this case, the number of real links should be
far fewerthan thefull-connected value of N(N21).
4.3 Aviation Networks
4.3.1 Small-worldeffects. Composedofairportsandroutes,aviationnetworksare
relativelysimpleexamplesoftransportationsystemsbecauseoftheirnon-planar
properties. Many real airport systems present distinct topological properties,
although there are some common architectures. Either for national aviation
systems, such as Italian (Guida & Maria, 2007), Indian (Bagler, 2008), Chinese
(Li & Cai, 2004; Lin, 2012; Wang, Mo, Wang, & Jin, 2011), USA (Paleari,
Redondi, & Malighetti, 2010), and so on, or for some regional (Paleari et al.,
2010; Sapre & Parekh, 2011) and worldwide aviation systems (Guimera` &
Amaral, 2004, 2005), the small-world structure is detected (Table 3), although
different results emerged as to the degree distributions. To some extent, the
small-world structure is acknowledged to be efficient for aviation networks (Chi
etal., 2003; Liu & Zhou, 2007).
4.3.2 Degree distribution and correlation. In aviation networks, the highly con-
nected nodes are not necessarily the most central ones in traffic because of the
multi-community structure of networks, resulting in some cities with high
degrees presenting low betweenness centrality (Guida & Maria, 2007; Guimera`,
Mossa, Turtschi, & Amaral, 2005). Most airport networks do not display a strict
power-law degree distribution; instead, the truncated or two-regime power-
laws (double Pareto law) are found (Table 3). Clauset, Shalizi, and Newman
(2009) explained in detail about the detection and characterization of power-law
distributions in empirical analysis. Readers who are interested in the two-
regime power law could refer Reed’s work about the Pareto law (Reed, 2003;
Reed & Jorgensen, 2004).
If an aviation network is considered as directed, there will be a strong corre-
lation between its in-degree and out-degree (Li & Cai, 2004; Rocha, 2009). It is
natural for aviation networks because each airport should maintain the balance
ofitstrafficflow.Besides,theheterogeneousdegreecorrelationsalsoarediscussed
widely.Fortheworldwideaviationnetwork,assortativityemergesonlyforcities
whose degree is smaller than 10 (Barrat et al., 2004). Comparatively, for some
national airport networks, disassortativity is detected after certain threshold
values of degree (Li & Cai, 2004; Wang etal., 2011).
Complex Network Topology 677
4.3.3 Efficiency. In aviation networks, the path length represents the number of
transfer times a passenger needs to take from origin to destination. Li and Cai
(2004) defined the diameter and efficiency of a sub-cluster and proved that a
shorter diameter indicates a more efficient network (Figure 7). In the Indian
airport network, around 99% of paths are reachable by changing a maximum of
twoflights(Bagler,2008).Besidesthepathlength,traveltimealsoneedstobecon-

ectflights(Palearietal,2010;Wangetal.,2011).Unfortunately,becauseitisdiffi-
culttocollectdataonthewaitingtimebetweendifferentflights,thereisnotmuch
progress onthis topic.
4.3.4 Evolution of aviation networks. It is necessary and interesting to study the
evolution of the topological structures in terms of the time scale; unfortunately,
only a few works exist in this direction because there are little data available.
The Brazilian airport network experienced overall growth during the time
period of 1995–2006, when some routes shrank (Rocha, 2009). However, there
was no clear fluctuation for the clustering coefficient or the average path length
during those years. Similar results also were concluded from the Chinese
airport network (Zhang, Cao, Du, & Cai, 2010).

4.4 Maritime TransportationNetworks
Another important part of the transport systems is ship-transport networks,
which carry 90% of the world’s trade (Kaluza, Kolzsch, Gastner, & Blasius,
2010). Strictly speaking, maritime transportation networks belong to the class of
non-planar graphs; however, they are still constrained by geographical embed-
ding. Xu, Hu, and Liu (2007a) first analyzed China’s ship-transport network,
which comprises 42 seaports, 120 river ports, and a large number of passenger
liners.Theyfoundthedisassortativemixingandapower-lawdegreedistribution
inL-space,butassortativemixingandtruncatedpowerlawinP-space.However,
thesmall-worldpropertyisapplicableinbothrepresentations,althoughitismuch
more visible in P-space. Besides, a hierarchical structure also is detected by con-
firming a scaling relation between the clustering coefficient and node degree of
the network. If considering the traffic flow between two ports as edge weight,
the weighted ship-transport network is symmetric, but the weight distribution
indicates a high level of heterogeneity, which is similar to aviation networks
(Guimera` & Amaral, 2004; Li & Cai, 2004).
Subsequently, a global perspective has been adopted. Hu and Zhu (2009)
probed the worldwide maritime transport network with links being container
liners, and found a small-world network with power-law behavior (Table 4). It
is not surprising that there are strong correlations between degree and degree,
strength and degree, or betweenness and degree, no matter whether they were
inthespaceLorP(Figure8).Besides,theyalsocalculatedtheweightedclustering
coefficient and the normalized rich-club coefficient of the network. Like the
railway networks in Table 1, the clustering coefficient in P-space is much larger
thantheoneinL-space.Whatisinterestingisthattheseweightedclusteringcoef-
ficientsarealsolargerthanunweightedonesinbothspaces,implyinghightraffic
edges betweeninterconnectedvertices.
Shortly after this work, Kaluza et al. (2010) enlarged the dataset to take into
account the bulk dry carriers, container ships, and oil tankers of global cargo
ships.Theydidnotcareaboutdifferentrepresentationsbutcomparedmovement
patterns of different ship types and group ports into sub-clusters by optimizing
themodularity.
Majimaetal.(2007)consideredthecombinationofrailway,subway,andwater-
bus networks in Tokyo. They proved that local efficiency has increased with the
combination. More importantly, the robustness and centrality around stations to
which the waterbus connects have increased.
4.5 Urban StreetNetworks
4.5.1 Self-organized and planned evolution patterns. Cities could be developed in
distinct ways, including self-organized (bottom-up) and planned (top-down)
evolutions. Differentiating and comparing the resultant street systems under
different growing mechanisms is of utmost importance for city planners and
policy-makers (Jiang, Duan, Lu, Yang, & Zhao, 2013). Scellato et al. (2006) calcu-

lated the edge betweenness and node information centrality of urban street
systems for Bologna and San Francisco, which are respectively representative
of self-organized and planned cities. They built the betweenness-based and
information-based maximum centrality spanning trees and the minimum length
spanning trees for two cities. Results showed that the shortest length performs
more effectively for simulating planned urban fabrics than self-organized ones,
whereas gathering people or resources is typical of the latter patterns. In terms
of some largerdatabases, the universal power law could be regardedas a signa-
ture of self-organized cities in most cases, although some exceptions still exist
(Crucitti et al., 2006; Scellato et al., 2006), while the cities under strict planning
are supposed to present an exponential (Crucitti et al., 2006) or two-regime cen-
trality distribution (Jiang, 2007).
4.5.2 Heterogeneity of urban street networks. Almost in the same period, some
researchersnoticedthatinanurbanstreetnetwork,onlyaveryfewstreetsinter-
sectwithalargenumberofotherstreets,whilemoststreetspossessveryfewinter-
sections.TakingVeneziaasanexample;just4outof783streetsoccupytheupper
20%intervalofthedegreerangeofvalues,whilethe674streetsfallintothelower
20%(Portaetal.,2006a).Jiang(2009)evenbelievedthatlessthan1%ofstreets,out
of the upper 20%, could form a backbone of the total street system. Lammer,
Gehlsen, and Helbing (2006) revealed an extreme concentration of traffic on
680 J. Linand Y.Ban
most important intersections, and introduced the Gini index to quantify the
betweenness centrality distribution of road networks. In Figure 9, the Gini
index of Dresden equals 0.870, signifying a high inequality. Almost 80% of the
traffic volume is concentrated on fewer than 10% of the streets. It is worth men-
tioning that such a broad heterogeneity may lead to traffic congestions on the
systems.
4.5.3 Planarity and cellular structures. Urban streetnetworks, asthemost funda-
mentalpartofinfrastructuresincities,presentstrictplanarity.Ifwebuildastreet

Themeshednessvaluesofrealsystemsareconsiderablyvariable,from0.009for

resultsofstudiesbasedonthe50largestmetropolitanareasintheUSA(Levinson,
2012),thata,b,gindexesincreasewiththecitysize.Incomparison,thecircuitness
is relatively stable, while the treeness decreases with the city size. It is easy to
understand this conclusion. The bigger a city is, the less dendritic it looks. With
economic and industrial developments, a large city or a large metropolitan will
evolve into a polycentric structure in the real world; it is also a critical issue
that needs tobe considered during the transport planning process.
Moreover,thelengthandtheareaofcellsarealsointerestingtoresearchers.The
former refers to the number of edges or vertices of a cell. Masucci et al. (2009)

5. Summary and Conclusions
This paper has reviewed research works that were produced during the last
decade on the topological structure of transport networks from a complex
network perspective. Generally, the representations for non-planar networks are
muchmorestraightforwardthanthoseofplanarnetworks.Forplanarnetworks,
the primal representation maintains the geometric patterns and geographical
properties of transportation systems, while the dual approach focuses on their
functional structures. As for urban public transportation systems, slight differ-
ences between representation approaches in L-space and P-space to extract
characteristics of stops, stations, and routes can cause distinct results on the
same system.
Withsignificantprogressincomplexnetworktheoryinthelastdecade,ahuge
numberofmeasureshavebeenpresentedtoestimatethedegreeofimportanceof
nodes, edges, and communities in networks. In this work, the authors classified
measures by comparing them among different scales. For a single node or an
edge, degree, betweenness, closeness, straightness, and strength centrality can
reveal respectively distinct features of a real transport network. Besides, from a
larger scale, the regional clustering and global measures are further discussed.
The last partin this section is allocated tocellular structure.
Followingthetheoreticalresearch,empiricalanalysesaredefinitelyanindispen-
sablesupplement.Herewesummarizedahugenumberofempiricalstudiesfrom
various subjects in terms of different kinds of transportation systems, including
railway systems, urban public transportation networks, aviation networks, mari-
time networks, and urban street networks. Results show that the complex
network theory discloses many more similar properties in real transport systems

proposesareviewofexistingapplications.
This review takes its inspiration from earlier ones by Borgatti et al. (2009) and
Crossley (2005, 2008) about sociology as well as Alderson (2008) on operations
research and Ducruet and Lugo (2013a) on transport networks and systems of cities.
We examine how the most popular theoretical models of networks proposed by
physicists (i.e. scale-free and small-world) have been integrated in the works of
geographers and regional scientists, assess what have been the benefits and speculate
whethersuchconceptsarelikelytoincreasetheirinfluenceinfurtherworks.Inafirst
attempt to evaluate the benefits of these approaches in geography, Rozenblat and
Mélançon(2007)noticedthat“thistypeofempiricalapproachcombiningaconceptual
approach of ‘small world theory’ and dedicated tools has not been developed in
geography”. Although more recent contributions from regional science do support
the necessity for further bridging “spatial economic science” with “network science”
(Reggiani 2011), little has been done in classifying existing applications of complex
networktheoryingeographicalresearch.

2NetworkAnalysisinGeographyandRegionalScience
Withoutbeing exhaustive,thisreviewwillconsiderthe evolutionofnetworkanalysis
in geography as a whole in the last few decades before addressing current issues and

main cause for the declining interest in spatial analysis as a whole, where network
analysis ‘remained somewhat of a backwater’ notably due to limited data availability
andcomputationalpower(XieandLevinson2009)anddespiteimprovementsprovided
by Geographical Information Systems (GIS) since the 1980s. Following an early
methodological transfer from mathematics and notably from French mathematician
Berge(Kansky1963:10–13),severalmeasureskeptbeingusedbygeographersunder

discussions(e.g.α,β,andγindices).AccordingtoGormanetal.(2004),fewscholars
have improved existing connectivity indices (i.e. indices that measure the quality of

Melançonand Rozenblat (2013) intheir effort for further bridging computersciences
andgeography.

aforementioned indices are generally unknown1. Indeed, such classic graph theory
measureshavebeencriticizedduetotheiroutdatedcharacter(Waters2006)andlackof

KurantandThiran2006),buttheyarestillusednowadaystodescribetheevolutionof

Wang et al. 2009). Such measures were also successfully applied by geographers to
manyplanarnetworksinearlyworkssuchasthedensityofnetworksallovertheworld
(Garrison 1960), the growth of the French railway network (Dancoisne 1984), the
connectivity of the Parisian subway network (Cicéri et al. 1977), and the hierarchical
structure of river networks (see also Haggett and Chorley 1969). Other contributions
about the modeling of transport network evolution (Taaffe et al. 1963) had great
influence on port geography research for instance (Ng and Ducruet forthcoming).
Thischaracterizationhas changed inthe 1990s when geographers startedtorepresent
and analyze non-planar networks, thereby stepping out of ‘classic’ graph theory and
thusneedingmoreadvancedtoolstorepresentandanalyzesuchnetworks.Studiesof
the European urban system progressively integrated a network dimension with the
worksofCattan(1995a,b)onairlinesandrailways,andRozenblatandPumain(1993)
on multinational firms, thereby opening new ways considering systems of cities (see
alsoBatty2008).
Relations between geographers, spatial scientists, and Social Network Analysts
(SNA)remainlimitedalthoughsociologistsdevelopedtheirtoolsfromthe1930swhile
focusing exclusively on non-planar graphs (Wasserman and Faust 1994). It is true
however that SNA remained marginal until the late 1960s throughout sociology
(Freeman 2004: 83–86), while the geographical tradition regarding network analysis
remained rather stable, thus contributing to limited dialogues between them. The

to Ducruet and Lugo (2013a), this also applies to the New Economic Geography
(NEG) where flows, networks, and distances are not introduced per se in existing
models,where,forinstance,citiesandregionsremainequallyspacedacrossanabstract

witnessed increasing importance in many discussions on global production networks,

3ComplexNetworksandSpace
3.1GeneralProperties
Theconceptsof‘small-worldnetwork’and‘scale-freenetwork’werefirstproposedby
the respective works of Watts and Strogatz (1998) and Barabási and Albert (1999).
Their goal was to define models of network organization differing from random
networks(ErdösandRényi1959).Inthislastmodel,linksbetweennodesarerandomly
distributed,therebyprovidinganormaldegreedistribution–thenodedegreebeingthe
number of links adjacent to it. As mentioned above in the case of geography, most
research in graph theory and network analysis in general has long been focused
primarily on regular and random networks – a network is called k-regular when each
nodehasthesamedegreeequaltok.Ifrandomnetworkswereimportantfordevelop-
mentofnetworkanalysis,theyhadnoimpactongeographicalstudies.
SWNs exhibit a small average path length between pairs of nodes – few links
separate node pairs on average - and a high local clustering coefficient – also called
transitivity by sociologists: probability for nodes that their adjacent neighbours are
linked. Thelatterdimensioncomes fromthe popular expressionbywhich myfriends
arealsofriendsor,inotherwords,ifAisconnectedwithBandC,thentheprobability
forBandCtobealsoconnectedishigh.Oneofthemaindrawbacksofthisdefinition
isitsextensiveness:ifweexcepttreegraph(graphwithoutcycle:impossibilitytofinda

nodes,resultinginastronghierarchicalstructure.Plottingthenodedegreedistribution

characteristics previously discovered in various fields, including urban geography. It

SWNsandSFNshaveincommonseveralfeatures(seeNewman2010forauseful
synthesis). Theyare moreefficientintermsofeaseofcirculationwithinthe network,
which can be measured by the average shortest path length, as those networks allow
limitingthenumberofstopsbetweentwonodesonaverage.Inaddition,theyinclude
many hubs (bridge nodes) and isthmuses (crucial links) between densely and tightly
connected communities or ‘clusters’, based on the idea of cliques (Wasserman and
Faust1994).Thesehubsandisthmusespresentgenerally ahighlevelofbetweenness
centrality – many paths in the network have to pass through these nodes (for a
mathematicaldefinition,seeWassermanandFaust1994).Butsuchnetworksalsohave
some important differences. SFNs are less ‘clustered’ than SWNs due to the stronger
influence of large degree nodes, which lowers the clustering coefficient. SFNs seem
more efficient as the presence of hubs provides optimal circulation and less friction.
SWNsare denserthanSFNsbecause removingfew hubswould resultinthe identifi-
cationofcommunities.Yet, largedegreenodes tendtoformcliques in SFNsand this

indicationwhetherthenetworkisscale-free,i.e.whenvaluesoftheexponentareover1
or even 2 (this threshold not being clearly defined). The existence of scale-free
networks is explained by a dynamic process called preferential attachment: when
new nodes are added to the network, they primarily connect the already large nodes,
thereby reinforcing the hierarchical structure (Internet is a nice example of this phe-
nomenon:a newwebsite onany subjectprimarily creates links towards mostpopular
websitesinthe samefield). SuchpropertiesinherenttoSWNsand SFNs wereinfact
alreadyexpressedinanumberofrelatedconceptsandgrowthmodels,asunderlinedby
the recent review provided by Zaidi (2011) on complex networks. Firstly, the power-
law structure and the preferential attachment process were already described by the
Yuleprocess,theGibratlaw,andtherank-sizerule,amongothers.Secondly,theworks
of Milgram (1967) as well as Travers and Milgram (1969) were in fact the first to
demonstrate the topological proximity among distant individuals and to label it as
‘small-worldphenomenon’.Earlier,firstproposedtheconceptoftriadtodepictmutual
acquaintances in a social network, and how they are likely to evolve. In geography,
Gibrat’smodelwasappliedtosystemsofcities(Robson1973;Pumain1982)aswellas
to urban economics (Gabaix and Ioannides 2004) to examine the evolution of urban
growththroughcitysizedistributions.
In fact, the merit of recent works by Watts and Strogatz (1998) and Barabási and
Albert (1999) has been to reincorporate such ideas into clearly defined models of
network structure and evolution, together with associated measures and methods
directly usable for empirical research. Several measures have been proposed to high-
light the properties of networks, such as the aforementioned power-law coefficient,
transitivity (clustering coefficient), and average shortest path length, together with
assortativity (degree-degree correlation). In the end, physicists have mostly relied on
existingmeasures,buttheyhavealsomodifiedandimprovedtheminordertotakethe
weightsintoaccount,whichhaslongremainedadrawbackofgraphtheory(Opsahland

cliquesinthegraph.Ifweightistakenintoaccount,directionalityisbarelyconsidered
by physicists, even when links are obviously directed (cf. Barábasi’s studies of the
Internet structure). A number of measures, however, are simply revisited without
referring to their background in graph theory and geography. This is the case of the
“rich-club coefficient” and the “greedytriangulation” being respectiveapplicationsof
the Gamma and Alpha indices proposed by Kansky (1963) - the first one is the ratio

Arecentbutpromisingtrendisthegrowinginterestofphysicistsinso-called‘spatial

associated measures, it appears necessary to look at this recent spatial perspective
proposedbyphysicists.
3.2TheSpatialDimension
A large number of research papers seeking small-world and scale-free properties in
networks of all kinds has been produced in the last two decades at exponential pace,
thusmakingreviewingthefieldexhaustivelydifficult.Giventhesimilarityofmethods
and measures from one case study to the other, we review a number of works
principallyfocusingonthespatialdimensionofSFNsandSWNs.
Natural scientists have themselves criticized mainstream research on networks due
tothe non-inclusion ofthe spatial, socialoreconomic dimension ingeneral measures
and models (Watts 2003: p.29 and 67; Evans 2010). In this respect, similar criticism
emergedabouttheActor-NetworkTheory(ANT)originatingfromsociologyandoften
neglecting the importance of space in the position of actors and its influence on their
relations (Bosco 2006). The material and geographical embedding of some networks
appears only implicitly in the small-world model, while it is absent of the scale-free
model2.Inaddition,Watts(1999)foundthatpreferentialattachmentoftenoccursover
shorter distances.A distinctcategoryofspatial networks3 thusemerged inanexplicit
way in the physics literature, which actually applies to a majority of real-world
networks in contrast with theoretical models of networks (Gastner and Newman
2006)andnon-spatialnetworks(e.g.socialnetwork,worldwideweb).Thegeograph-
icaldimensionofsocialnetworkshas,however,beendiscussedregularlyasshownin
anextensivereviewpublishedbypsychologistsinaphysicsjournal(Wongetal.2006).
They demonstrate the importance of distance in random graphs by means of Monte
Carlo simulation methods, where main results underline a decreasing probability for
densityandcommunityformationasdistanceincreases.Similarresultswerefoundon
thebasisofsocialdistance(Bogunaetal.2004).
2Barabási (2002) recognized that cities connecting thousands of highways simply do not exist, thereby
recognizingimplicitlyphysicalconstraintstonetworkgrowth.
3Spatialnetworksarealsocoinedgeographicalnetworks,technologicalnetworks,infrastructurenetworks,ad-
hocnetworks,orphysicalnetworksintheliterature.
SpatialScienceandNetworkScience:ReviewandOutcomes 303
Yet, many works on spatial networks do not specifically measure their spatial
dimension,astheyonlylookattheirtopologicaldimensionasinthecaseofmaritime
networks (Hu and Zhu 2009) and commuter flows (De Montis et al. 2010; Reggiani
etal.2011b;CaschiliandDeMontis2013)wheredistanceparametersarenotincluded.
Spatial networks are defined by physicists (Barthélemy 2010) through some funda-
mental properties: physical embedding and interaction range. Physical embedding
refersto nodes and/or links being grounded in a physical(Euclidian) space, which in
turnconstrainsthemultiplicationoflinksandorientatesthelayoutofthenetwork,with
the crucial importance of borders. Interaction range means that distance metrics (and
related costs) play a central role in the emergence, distribution, and weight of links,
sincespatialproximityisonedominantfactorfavouringshort-rangeversuslong-range
interaction.
Several scholars have thus explored the influence of spatial structure on network
topology in static and dynamics ways (Waters 2006). Among the earliest attempts to
validatethisidea,Barthélemy(2003and2010)showedthatspatialnetworksingeneral
exhibit higherclusteringcoefficientsthan non-spatial networksdue tothe importance
ofproximityinnodeconnectivity(seealsoKaiserandHilgetag2004).Furtherresults
were provided by Barrat et al. (2005) based on the case of air transport highlighting
several other properties of spatial networks such as: fewer global hubs and more
regionalhubs,higherdisassortativityasthenetworkgrows(nodeshavingahighdegree
tend to connect preferentially with nodes having a low degree), higher correlation
betweendegreeandbetweenness,increasedinfluenceofthebarycentreonbetweenness
values, and increased cliquishness. However, the fundamental difference between
planar and non-planar networks is not always considered by physicists. For instance,
planarspatialnetworksaremorephysicallyconstrainedandthusaremoreassortative,
with a higher probability to contain a giant component (i.e. connected subgraph
including a majority of the nodes), while non-planar spatial networks are more likely
toexhibitscale-freeproperties(Bullocketal.2010).Spatialorgeographicalnetworks
arealsolessvulnerabletorandomattacksonhubswhileaddingmorelocallinksfurther
eliminates such vulnerability (Hayashi and Matsukubo 2006; Gosak et al. 2011).
Lambiotte etal. (2008) haveargued, however, thatalthoughspatialnetworksvalidate
the gravity model, they are also made of crucial long-distance links deforming the
predictions. A study of the evolution of the Swiss road and railway networks (Erath
et al. 2009) also discussed the limited accuracy of complex network measures for
studying spatial, planar networks, thereby complementing them with local network
densitymeasures.
Methods used for testing the influence of spatial embedding range from the
inclusion of simple distance parameters to the simulation and modelling of
complex networks embedded in two-dimensional space (for an early review
see Boccaletti et al. 2006, pp. 205-212), based on the hypothesis that connec-
tivity is a function of distance (Barnett et al. 2007). Notably, Crucitti et al.
(2006) take into account physical distance in their calculation of node central-
ity, arguing that their results may be more useful to urban planning and design.
In the same vein, Cardillo et al. (2005) include metric distance in their analysis
of urban streets, notably comparing observed and optimal efficiency, while
Gattuso and Miriello (2005) reviewed the possible measures to analyze metro
networks topologically and geographically. Andersson et al. (2005) tested the
304 C. Ducruet,L. Beauguitte
influence of various parameters, such as transport costs, on the emergence of
power-laws in land values. Other works adopted a node redundancy approach
to study the influence of spatial structure on cascading failures (Huang et al.
2005), arguing that stronger geographical constraints foster the ‘reservoir effect’
of hubs (i.e. redistribution of traffic from smaller nodes to larger nodes situated
in close proximity), while such spatial networks face higher risks of becoming
disconnected due to their higher density. Expert et al. (2011) adapted a mod-
ularity function – modularity being a measure of clustering quality – to spatial
networks in order to better understand the influence of the spatial factor on
network structure, with an application to Belgian mobile phone communication
flows between individuals. They particularly revealed the regionalization of the
network based on an extension of the modularity algorithm. When it comes to
the simultaneous analysis of several spatial networks, Parshani et al. (2010)
notably demonstrated that location matters in the inter-similarity of networks,
based on ports and airports’ geographical coordinates. One last point must be
made: the planarity of graphs has never been a great subject of concern except
in geography, the most obvious example being the manual from Haggett and
Chorley where non-planar graphs are mentioned twice only (1969: p.4 and 7).
More recently, efforts have been made to model the growth of urban streets to
reveal historical paths (Barthélemy and Flammini 2009; Strano et al. 2012).
If physicists, computer scientists, but also other disciplines (see Davis et al. 2003;
Flemingetal.2007),integratemoreandmorespaceintheirnetworkstudies,howhave
geographers integrated these new models and measures? The next section proposes a

connections and the economic well-being of localities in the UK communication
network. Other works also demonstrated inadequacies between network topologies
and local development when looking at knowledge networks across urban agglomer-
ationssuchasco-authorshipsonaworld level (Matthiessenetal.2006) and in China
(Liefner and Hennemann 2011). In addition, Ducruet et al. (2011a) compared the
betweenness centrality of cities in air and sea flows separately and jointly, revealing
the importance of the regional setting versus general laws by which more diversified
cities would always dominate more specialized cities. At the intra-city level, street
centralitywas found to have strongaffinitieswithretail and service concentrationsin
Bologna(Portaetal.2009)andBarcelona(Produitetal.2010;Portaetal.2012).
4.1.2TheRoleofDistance
Surprisingly,distanceparametersarebarelyintroducedbygeographersintheirstudyof
networks. This stems from the belief and implicit claim by geographers that space
alwaysmatters:theythereforedonotseektoprovethisassumptionbutratherlookat
how other dimensions (social, political, historical) are reflected across space. It was
found, however, that seaports with larger degree connect over longer kilometric
distances on average based on worldwide inter-port maritime links, based on the
average length of the longest links at each degree value (Ducruet and Zaidi 2012).
While the shortest maritime links concentrate the highest proportion of all global
shippingflows (DucruetandNotteboom2012),theaverageand maximumkilometric
distances through which ports connect each other have a strong influence on port
throughputs(Ducruetetal.2011b).Inthesameveinbutbasedonmultiplecommodity
flows, Ducruet (2013a) demonstratedthe strong influence ofphysicaldistance on the
diversityofmaritimetrafficsamongportsoftheworld:morediversifiedportsconnect
over longer distances on average, but more diversified links are shorter because the
probability of carrying various sorts of goods decreases as distance increases. When
studyingtheIndianapolisroadnetwork,Gleyze(2007)proposedtodistinguishamong

networks effects and spatial effects inthe measurementofbetweenness centralityand
eccentricity (node tendency to be apart from the whole network), so as to reveal the
influence of friction on centrality measures, just like, more recently, in the work of
VitaliandBattiston(2011)onEuropeanfirmsbutwithoutreferringtosameliteratures.
Jiang and Claramunt (2004) offered a very original approach to urban streets by
considering streets as nodes and crossroads as links in their analysis of small-world
dimensionsand centralities, inthe tradition ofthe space syntaxapproachtonetworks
(seeHillierandHanson1984)alsodevelopedbyPortaetal.(2006)ingeography.
4.1.3ComplementaryMethods
Aseriesofstudieshavecomplementedacomplexnetworkapproachbyothermethods
inregionalscienceandsociology(SNA).Forinstance,Patuellietal.(2007)combined
complex networks and Spatial Interaction Models (SIM), and Gorman and Kulkarni
(2004) applied SNAmethods (e.g. structuralequivalence) intheir analysisofInternet
backbonenetworksintheUS.Gormanetal.(2007)alsocomparedtheresultsobtained
from spatial interaction methods (i.e. the gravity model) and complex networks

sea global networks notably contributed to the fast-growing research field of coupled
infrastructure networks developed in recent years (see Vespignani 2010). Andersson
et al. (2006) discussed the benefits of using complex networks in conjunction with
spatial interaction models and multiplicative growth models in the analysis of urban
growth, while Schintler et al. (2007) proposed to link raster-based Geographic
Information Systems (GIS), graph theory, and complex networks theory to analyze
theroadandrailwaynetworksofFlorida.AlthoughtheworkofBarberetal.(2011)on
theidentificationofcommunitieswithintheEuropeannetworkofresearchanddevel-
opmentcollaboration shows more affinity withSocial Network Analysis, it alsoused
themodularityalgorithmproposedbyphysics.
4.1.4Clusters,Communities,Regions
Fourth,geographershavebeenparticularlyinterestedinthemulti-levelorganizationof
networks. This has led to the refinement of clustering methods when studying the
worldwide airline network of intercity passenger flows based on strength clustering
(Amiel et al. 2005; Rozenblat et al. 2013) or the Atlantic liner shipping network
looking at the correspondence between spatial proximity among seaports and their
belonging to same clusters based on the bisecting k-means method (Ducruet et al.
2010).AnotherexampleistheanalysisbyRozenblat(2010)ofthelocationallogicsof
multinational firms led both within and among cities. In order to propose new delin-
eations of urban metropolitan areas, Tissandier et al. (2013) also applied the strength
clustering method to commuter flows in France, while Drevelle (2013) applied
blockmodelingtothegraphofcommuterflowsintheMontpellierurbanareatodetect
the emergence of secondary poles in the suburbs. The analysis of mobile phone
SpatialScienceandNetworkScience:ReviewandOutcomes 307
communication networks rightfully demonstrated the importance of geographic prox-
imity in the emergence of communities, notwithstanding the influence of borders
(Blondel et al. 2010), thereby echoing former studies of this kind based on simpler
techniques (Nystuen and Dacey 1961; Cattan 1995a, b). Other approaches have
clustered and mapped vehicle trajectories so as to reveal traffic regions in Athens
(Guoetal.2010).Itisverysurprisingthatthisresearchdirectionhasthelowestnumber
of works, given the traditional endeavor by geographers to reveal regional structures.
Yet, the role of physical distance in the formation of clusters and regions remains
indirectlytested,exceptbyGleyze(2013)discussingmethodsoftopologicalclustering
onspatialnetworks.
4.1.5InterdependentNetworks
Despite the lack of mathematical formalization of multigraphs and multiplex graphs
(i.e. graph where several types of links exist between nodes), several works have
recently focused on networks characterized by multiple relations among the nodes,
notably in physics (Buldyrev et al. 2010; Parshani et al. 2010; Rosato et al. 2008;
Vespignani2010).Someofthememploystatisticalmeasuresontimeseriestostudythe
co-evolutionofvariousnodesand linksovertime(Bogart2009)whileothersapplied
moreconventionalgraphtheoreticmethodstothecombinationofvariouslinksamong
French cities to reveal regional urban systems (Berroir et al. 2012) as well as social
network analysis methods such as blockmodeling (i.e. clustering method based on
directionality) to trade and diplomatic relations among world countries to reveal the
emergence of a European entity (Beauguitte 2010). While geographers and regional
scientistsclearlyrecognizedtheneedtoenvisagethesimultaneityofmultiplerelations
among nodes (Zhang et al. 2005), they provided efforts mostly at the local level in
ordertoevaluatethespecializationlevelofnodesinmultiplenetworks.Severalstudies
haveaddressedtheconceptualandmethodologicalchallengesbroughtbytheanalysis
of multiple networks in various contexts, such as airlines and Internet networks
(Devriendt et al. 2010; Tranos 2011), airlines and corporate networks (Liu et al.
2013). Another example is Ducruet et al. (2011a) who compared the betweenness
centrality of cities in the combined global network of air and sea flows with their
centrality in each single network. They also applied a single linkage analysis to the
couplednetworkinordertodemonstratetheinfluenceoftheregionalcontextbywhich
dominant European cities remain highly specialized (i.e. being central in either air or
sea flows) while in the rest of the world, diversified cities (i.e. having a balanced
positioninairandseaflows)tendtopolarizeothercities.Insuchworksaswellasfor
physicists, the geographical criteria are fundamental to study the interdependence of
networksbasedontheirphysicalcorrespondencethroughspatiallyembeddednodes.
4.1.6EvolutionandDynamicsofNetworks
Geographers have paid particular attention to the evolution of networks, in more
concrete ways than physicists due to the use of real-world empirical time-series data.
Notably, Vinciguerra et al. (2010) tested the influence of geographical distance and
country borders on the evolution of the European Internet backbone network, with
reference to the Barabási-Albert model of preferential attachment. The evolution of
308 C. Ducruet,L. Beauguitte
inter-city scientific research partnerships was studied by Comin (2009) to reveal the
reinforcedpositionoflargercitiesinthenetworkovertimedespitethemultiplicationof
linkstowardssecond-tiercities.Thediachronicdimensionisindeedmuchneglectedby
physicists when it comes to actual data rather than simulation models. This research
direction remains, however, little explored by geographers as most of their contribu-
tions remain highly static. Most of the time, one same network is mapped and/or
visualizedatdifferenttimeperiodswithoutquestioningtheunderlyingmechanismsof
theobserveddynamics.Simulationexperimentsareoftenappliedtoasetoflocations
such as cities but among which the links remain implicit (Bretagnolle and Pumain
2010).Anotherrecentexample,ishowever,providedbyLugo(2013)whomodeleda
system of cities connected by road as a planar spatial network and proposed a
preferential attachment process based on the size of cities and infrastructure data.

4.2Collaborationpatterns
So as to better situate geographers in the wider research community on complex
networks, Fig. 1 proposesan overviewof collaborationsin the form ofa graphwhere
nodesare articleauthorsanddisciplineshavedifferentcolours.This sampleof articles
comprises the aforementioned works on complex networks including at least one
geographer and/or regional scientist besides other scholars belonging to other social
sciences (e.g. sociology, history, psychology, etc.), physics, computer science, and
engineering. One clearly observes distinct combinations of scientific expertise in the
integration between complex network methods and geographical issues, as well as a
numberofconnectedcomponentswithnolinksbetweenthem.Physicistswereincluded
inonlyfourresearchgroupscontaininggeographers,andthreeofthosegroupsarethe
largestintermsofthenumberofauthors.Thissuggeststhenecessityforgeographersto
have attained sufficient critical mass before attracting people from natural sciences.
ExceptforthegroupledbyGormanthatdoesnotincludephysicists,thefouraforemen-
tioned groups contain at least one scholar from other social sciences as well as from
computer science and engineering. Innovation in geography thus necessitated wide
collaborationsacross differentfields. Othergroups without physicists and/or computer
scientistsremainsmallerinsizeandboundtoasingleteamspecializedinonetopic.In
addition,theroleofgeographersdiffersamongthegroups:itcanberelativelyperipheral
(i.e. mobile phone networks, urban streets) or very central (i.e. air and sea networks,
urban growth). In the two latter cases, geographers have thus been either followers/
externalexpertsorleaders/launchersofrelatedresearchprojects.Amongthetwolarge
groups where geographers dominate by their number, one remains specialized in eco-
nomicswhiletheotherincludesphysicistsandcomputerscientists.Althoughsuchgroups

regional science is one main conclusion which may have various causes. On the one
hand, the shift away from structural approaches in the 1970s can be seen as one of
them. The concept of network has gained unprecedented importance in geographical
thought,butthishasoccurredfromaconceptualratherthanamethodologicalperspec-
tive, with a strong emphasis on actors, scales, innovation, and power relations across
space (Pflieger and Rozenblat 2010). Yet, this cannot explain why quantitative geog-
raphers have not been faster in adopting SFNs and SWNs, as they did in the 1960s
when integrating graph theory. One major difference with the context of the 1960s
remains the difficulty for geographers to access and handle large-scale datasets and
thus,tomasterrelatedmethodsofanalysisinthefieldsofdataminingandstatistics.On
the other hand, one likely reason is the limited innovation brought by complex
networks research to geography, the power law distribution being for example an
obvious non-discovery (Reggiani and Vinciguerra 2011), but again, no geographer
hasclearlyexpressedsuchcritiqueinaformalreviewofthefieldasitwasdonebythe
aforementioned sociologists. More likely are direct applications of network measures
andindiceswithoutanyreferencetowiderreflectionsoncomplexitytheory,although
the bridge between complexity, geography, and spatial economics has been firmly
made in both conceptual and empirical ways (Lane et al. 2009). Further progress in
thecross-fertilizationbetweennetworkscienceandspatialscienceshouldthenbeboth
conceptualandpractical:whatarewemeasuring?Whatdotheresultsmean?Whatdo
welearnnew,toanswerwhichquestion(s)?
Many tools exist nowadays (e.g., GIS, R packages) which can provide a valuable
help to test measures and methods on networks. Geographers focusing on migration,
economy, political geography, without mentioning transport geography, could surely
examinefurthertherelevanceoftheseinnovations.Questioningtheirrelevancecannot

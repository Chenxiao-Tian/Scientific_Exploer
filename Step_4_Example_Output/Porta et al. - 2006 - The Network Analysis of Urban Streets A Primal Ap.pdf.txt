Finally, our work also shows that centrality is not just one single thing in spatial
systems.Centralityisamultifacetedconceptthat,inordertomeasurethe‘importance’
of single actors, organizations, or places in complex networks, has led to a number of
different indices. We show that such indices, at least those mentioned in this paper,
belong to four different concepts of being central as being near, being between, being
straightto,andbeingcriticalfortheothers:thediversityofthese‘families’iswitnessed
by the consistentlydifferent distributions of centrality scores in considered cases, both
in terms of spatial flows as mapped in red-and-blue layouts and in terms of statistical
distributionsasshownincumulativeplots.Wealsoshowthatsuchindices,whenapplied
to geographic networks, capture different ways for a place to be central, ways that
seem to be always working together, often in reciprocal contradiction, in shaping our
perception, cognition, and usage of urban spaces.
A new approach to the network analysis of centralities in geographic systems
is therefore appearing. Its three pillars are (1) primal graphs; (2) metric distance;
(3) manydifferent indices ofcentrality. As such, we may well name it multiple central-
ity assessment. Offering a set of multifaceted pictures of reality, rather than just one,
MCA leads to more argumentative, thus less assertive, indications for action.
On this basis, further research may well proceed in three directions. First, signifi-
cant achievements are likely to be gained after establishing correlations between
centralities of the networks and dynamics on the networks (such as land uses, real-
estate values, the location of social groups, crime rates, community retail vitality, and
pedestrianandvehicularflows(cid:246)thatis,by recodingcentrality indices inthe contextof

to systems at different scales, from the macroregional to the microarchitectural.

Abstract.The network metaphor in the analysis of urban and territorial cases has a long tradition,
especially in transportation or land-use planning and economic geography. More recently, urban
design has brought its contribution by means of the ‘space syntax’ methodology. All these
approaches(cid:246)though under different terms like‘accessibility’,‘proximity’,‘integration’ ‘connectivity’,
‘cost’, or ‘effort’(cid:246)focus on the idea that some places (or streets) are more important than others
because they are more central. The study of centrality in complex systems, however, originated in
otherscientificareas,namelyinstructuralsociology,wellbeforeitsuseinurbanstudies;moreover,as
a structural property of the system, centrality has never been extensively investigated metrically
in geographic networks as it has been topologically in a wide range of other relational networks such
associal,biological,ortechnologicalones.Afterapreviousworkonsomestructuralpropertiesofthe
primalgraphrepresentationofurbanstreetnetworks,inthispaperweprovideanin-depthinvestiga-
tion of centrality in the primal approach as compared with the dual one. We introduce multiple
centrality assessment (MCA), a methodology for geographic network analysis, which is defined and
implementedon four1-square-mileurbanstreetsystems.MCAprovidesadifferentperspectivefrom
space syntax in that: (1) it is based on primal, rather than dual, street graphs; (2) it works within a
metric, rather than topological, framework; (3) it investigates a plurality of peer centrality indices
rather thanasingleindex.Weshowthat,intheMCAprimalapproach,much morethan in thedual
approach, some centrality indices nicely capture the ‘skeleton’of the urban structure that impacts
so much on spatial cognition and collective behaviours. Moreover, the distributions of centrality in
self-organizedcitiesaredifferentfromthoseinplannedcities.
1 Introduction: which order for urban street patterns?
Since the dawn of modernity the power of Euclidean geometry has been immensely
influential for ‘‘certain man using reason’’ (Descartes, 1994, page 27) such as an
architect or urban designer, and it is almost an axiom when it comes to the design of
streets, towns, and cities. Against uneven and windy street patterns [‘‘le chemin des
a“nes’’(therouteofasses),LeCorbusier,1994,pages 5^7]modernityhasbeendiffusing
grid-likeandgeometric structures [‘‘le chemin des Hommes’’ (the route ofmen)] as the
signofanewera.Stilltodayoldneighborhoodsareoftenunderestimatedintheir most
fundamental values: they might be considered picturesque, even attractive, but their
structure is not so valuable: it is disordered. Against this modernist stigmatization, a
whole stream of counterarguments have been raised since the early1960s in the name
ofthe‘magic’ofoldcities(Jacobs,1993).Theclaimwasnotjustaboutaesthetics:itwas
about livability. The modern city is hard to live in. The social success of an urban
settlement emerges from the complex, uncoordinated interaction of countless different
routes and experiences in a suitable environment. Is this a nostalgic claim to a
prescientific era? Jane Jacobs argued, following Weaver (Jacobs, 1961; Weaver, 1948),
706 SPorta,P Crucitti,VLatora
that cities are complex-organized problems and, as such, in order to be understood,
they requiretobe approachedwith anewscience:onlyby means ofthe newscience of
complexity can the ‘marvelous’complex order of the old city be revealed that, unlike
the Euclidean geometry, is not visible at a first glance, is not imposed by any central
agency, but, rather, sprouts out from the uncoordinated contribution of countless
agents in time.That order, Jacobs concluded, is the orderof life: that is why it fosters
human life in cities; it is that order which builds the sustainable city of the future
(Newman and Kenworthy,1999).
So long evocated, clues to the complex order of life are now revealed. Following
structuralstudies inbiologyand sociology, new insightshavebeen gainedwhichreveal
thatthemostdiverseofsuchsystemsdoshareastonishinglysimilartopologicalproper-
ties (Albert and Baraba¤si, 2002; Baraba¤si, 2002; Watts and Strogatz, 1998). Among
others, our studies on urban street networks (Crucitti et al, 2006) have shown that the
same properties actually rule those cases as well. These achievements allow us to
acknowledge, under the seeming disorder of self-organized cities, a rule of preferential
attachment and hierarchical topology that operates, in an embedded way, in the most
diverse climatic, geographic, economic, social, and cultural conditions(cid:246)an order
shared with most nongeographic natural, biological, and social systems (Portugali,
2000; Ravasz and Baraba¤si, 2003; Salingaros, 2003).
Herewemake astep forwardbydefiningthe multiplecentralityassessment(MCA),
a methodology for the primal analysis of centralities on urban street systems. In
section 2 a short review of centrality indices since the early 1950s is presented; a
comparison is then addressed between ‘space syntax’, a well-known methodology for
the dual analysis of street systems, and previously defined indices of centrality, which
leads to the understanding of space syntax in the light of a broader framework and to
the acknowledgement of its historical roots. In section 3 a brief discussion of the two
different approaches(cid:246)the primal and the dual(cid:246)to the graph representation of urban
street systems is presented. In section 4 selected indices of centrality are investigated
over fourcases ofurbanstreetnetworksspatially, throughthe presentation ofthematic
maps, and statistically, by plotting their cumulative distributions. The main message
of this paper is then presented in section 5: the proposed MCA, grounded on a set of
different centrality indices investigated over a primal, metric representation of street
networks leads to an extended comprehension of the ‘hidden orders’ that underlie the
structure of real, geographic spatial systems.
2 From structural sociology to space syntax: defining centrality indices
The basic idea in structural sociology is to represent a group of people as a network
whose nodes arethe individuals andwhose edges arerelationshipsbetween individuals
(Wasserman and Faust,1994). Bavelas was the first to realize that a central location in
the network structure corresponds to power in terms of independence, influence, and
control on the others (Bavelas,1948). Freeman’s masterworks on centrality (Freeman,
1977; 1979) reviewed and coordinated under the same roof previous researches
addressed since the early 1950s (Bavelas, 1948; 1950; Leavitt, 1951; Shaw, 1954; 1964;
Shimbel, 1953), and defined a first set of indices: degree (CD), closeness (CC), and
betweenness (CB) centralities.
More recently, new evidence has been obtained that complex networks in many
different economic, social, natural, and man-made systems share some common struc-
tural properties. A first shared property is related todistanceand clustering: in fact, it
hasbeen shown that mostofthose networks exhibitthesmall-worldproperty, meaning
that the average topological distance between a couple of nodes is small compared
with the size of the network, despite the fact that the network exhibits a large local
The network analysis ofurban streets 707
clustering typical of regular lattices (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). A second shared
property is more related to centrality(cid:246)that is, the distribution of a node’s degree.
The node’s degree k is the number of its connections, nothing other than a centrality
measure CD. The study of a large number of complex systems, including networks
as diverse as man-made systems such as the World Wide Web and the Internet
(Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2004), social networks such as the movie actors
collaboration network or networks of sexual contacts (Liljeros et al, 2001), and many
biological networks (Albert and Baraba¤si, 2002), has shown that, in most of such
cases, the degree distribution follows, for large degree k, a power law scaling
P(k) (cid:136) N =N(cid:24)k(cid:255)g, with the exponent g being between 2 and 3, and where N is
k k
the number of nodes having k links, and N is the total number of nodes. Networks
withsuchadegreedistributionhavebeennamedscalefree(AlbertandBaraba¤si,2002).
The results found are particularly interesting in contrast with what is expected for
random graphs (Erdo«s and Re¤nyi, 1959). In fact, a random graph with N nodes and
K edges (an average of k(cid:22)per node)(cid:246)that is, a graph obtained by randomly selecting
theKcouplesofnodestobeconnected(cid:246)exhibitsaPoissondegreedistributioncentred
(cid:22)
at k, with an exponential behavior and not a power law behavior for large values of k.
In formal terms a network can be represented as a graph G (cid:136) (N,K), a mathe-
matical entity defined by two sets, N and K. The first set, N, is a nonempty set of N
elements called nodes, vertices, or points, and K is a set of K elements containing
unordered pairs of different nodes called links or edges. In the following discussion a
node will be referred to by its order i in the set N, with 14i4N. If there is an edge
between nodes i and j, the edge being indicated as (i,j), the two nodes are said to be
adjacent or connected. Sometimes it is useful to consider a valued, or weighted graph
G (cid:136) (N,K,O), defined by three pairs of sets N, K, and O. The set O is a set of K
elements,beingthenumericalvaluesattachedtotheedges,andmeasuringthestrengths
of the tie. A graph G (cid:136) (N,K) can be described by a single matrix, the so-called
adjacency matrix A (cid:136) fa g, an N(cid:2)N square matrixwhose element a is equal to1if
ij ij
(i,j) belongs to K, and 0 otherwise. A weighted graph G (cid:136) (N,K,O) can be
described by giving two matrices, the adjacency matrix A, defined as above, and a
matrix Wcontainingthe edgeweights. Intheparticularcase ofa spatial(orgeographic)
graph(cid:246)that is, a graph whose nodes have a precise position in a two-dimensional or
three-dimensional Euclidean space and whose links are real physical connections(cid:246)we
find ituseful toworkwith lengths in place ofweights,suchthat,insteadofthe weights
matrixW,wewillconsiderthelengthsmatrixL (cid:136) fl g,anN(cid:2)N matrixwhoseentry
ij
l is the metric length of the link connecting i and j (a quantity inversely proportional
ij
to the weight associated with the edge). In a valued graph the shortest path length d
ij
between i and j is defined as the smallest sum of the edge lengths throughout all the
possible paths in the graph from i to j, whereas in a nonvalued graph itis simplygiven
by the smallest number of steps required to go from i to j.
ThecharacteristicpathlengthL(WattsandStrogatz,1998)isdefinedastheaverage

In the case that G is unconnected and there is no path linking i and j, d (cid:136) 1 and,

The global efficiency is correlated to 1=L, with a high characteristic path length
corresponding to a low efficiency (Latora and Marchiori, 2003). By definition, in the
topological (nonvalued graph) case, Eglob takesvalues inthe interval [0,1], and is equal
to1for the complete graph [agraphwith all the possible N(N(cid:255)1)=2 edges]. In metric
systems (translated into valued graphs), however, it is possible to normalize (Latora
and Marchiori, 2001; 2002) such a quantity by dividing Eglob(G) by the efficiency

that is, the length of a virtual direct connection i^j. In this way we have
Eglob(G) (cid:136) Eglob(cid:133)G)=Eglob(cid:133)Gideal). A different normalization has been proposed in

We now have the setup to define and discuss the various measures of centrality. The
three indicesofcentralityreportedinFreeman (1977;1979)canberoughlydivided into
two different families (Latora and Marchiori, 2004). Both CD and CC can be seen as
belonging to the same concept of being central as being near others (Freeman, 1977;
1979; Nieminen, 1974; Sabidussi, 1966; Scott, 2003; Shimbel, 1953), and CB measures
canbeviewedasbeingcentralintermsofbeingbetween(thatisbeingtheintermediary
of others (Anthonisse, 1971; Freeman, 1977; 1979; Freeman et al, 1991; Newman and
Girvan,2003). Afteranumberofrevisions and applications through over fourdecades
(Altman, 1993; Bonacich, 1972; 1987; 1991; Stephenson and Zelen, 1989), such indices
havebeenchangedandextendedtodifferentcases,butthebasicfamilieshavenotbeen
changed so much. In transportation planning, for instance, the accessibility of a place
is still intended to mean its ‘ability’ to be accessed within a short time from all other
places, which is in essence(cid:246)other than the fact that distance is measured by a much
more complex notion of transportation cost(cid:246)a kind of CC.
The growth of interest in the network analysis of complex systems has led to new
indices of centrality. For the purposes of this paper three of them, namely efficiency,
straightness, and information, all based on global efficiency, are relevant. Efficiency
centrality CE, a kind of closeness, when applied to geographic graphs and normalized
bycomparingthelengthofshortestpathswiththatofvirtualstraightlinesbetweenthe
same nodes (Vragov|'c et al, 2004), turns out to capture a new, inherently geographic
concept that we term straightness centrality, CS: being central as being more directly
reachable by all others in the network. Information centrality CI embeds both CC and
The network analysis ofurban streets 709
CB in a single quantity (Latora and Marchiori, 2004), and leads to another distinct
concept of being central as being critical forothers.
2.1 Being near others: degree and closeness centrality
Degree centrality isbasedonthe ideathatimportantnodeshavethelargestnumberof
ties to other nodes in the graph.The degree of a node is the number of edges incident
with the node, the number of first neighbours of the node.The degree k of node i is
P i
defined in terms of the adjacency matrix as k (cid:136) a . The degree centrality (CD)
i ij
j2N
of i is defined as (Freeman,1979; Nieminen,1974):
X
a
ij
k
CD (cid:136) i (cid:136) j2N . (6)
i N(cid:255)1 N(cid:255)1
The normalization adopted is such that CC takes on values between 0 and 1, and is
equal to 1 when a node is connected to all the other nodes of the graph. Degree
centrality is not relevant in the primal representations, in which a node’s degree
(the number of streets incident in that intersection) is substantially limited by spatial
constraints.
The simplest notion of closeness is based on the concept of minimum distance or
geodesic d (cid:246)that is, the smallest sum of the edge lengths throughout all the possible
ij
paths in the graph from i to j in a weighted graph, or the minimum number of edges
traversed in a topological graph. The closeness centrality of pointi (Freeman, 1979;
Sabidussi,1966;Wasserman and Faust,1994) is:
N(cid:255)1
CC (cid:136) L(cid:255)1 (cid:136) X , (7)
i i d
ij
j2N;j6(cid:136)i
where L is the average distance from node i to other nodes. Such an index is mean-
i
ingful for connected graphs only, unless one artificially assumes d to be equal to a
ij
finite value when there is no path between two nodes i and j, and to take on values
between 0 and1in the case of nonvalued graphs.
2.2 Being between others: betweenness centrality
Interactionsbetween two nonadjacentnodes might depend on intermediate nodes that
can have a strategic control or influence on them.This concept can be simply quanti-
fiedbyassumingthatcommunicationtravelsalongonlygeodesics. Namely,if n isthe
jk
numberofgeodesics linking the two nodes j and k, and n is the numberofgeodesics
jk
linking the two nodes j and k that contain node i, the betweenness centralityof node i
is defined as (Freeman,1979):
1 X n (cid:133)i(cid:134)
CB (cid:136) jk . (8)
i (cid:133)N(cid:255)1(cid:134)(cid:133)N(cid:255)2(cid:134) n
j;k2N;j6(cid:136)k; j;k6(cid:136)i jk
CB takes on values between 0 and 1 and reaches its maximum when node i falls on
i
all geodesics. Here we just mention two other indices of betweenness that include
contributions from nongeodesic paths: the flow betweenness and the random paths
betweenness; however, in this study, we use the shortest paths betweenness defined in
equation (8).
2.3 Being direct to the others: efficiencyand straightness centrality
Efficiencyand straightness centralities originatefromtheideathatthe efficiencyinthe
communication between two nodes i and j is equal to the inverse of the shortest path
710 SPorta,P Crucitti,VLatora
length d (Latora and Marchiori, 2001).Thus, the efficiency centrality of node i is:
ij !, !
X 1 X 1
CE (cid:136) . (9)
i d dEucl
j2N;j6(cid:136)i ij j2N;j6(cid:136)i ij
Straightness centrality is a variant of efficiency centrality, and originates from a
different normalization (Vragov|'c et al, 2004).The straightness of node i is:
!,
X dEucl
CS (cid:136) ij (cid:133)N(cid:255)1(cid:134). (10)
i d
j2N;j6(cid:136)i ij
This measure captures how much the connecting routes from node ito all other nodes
in the graph deviate from the virtual straight routes.
2.4 Being critical for all the others: information centrality
The information centrality of a node i is defined as the relative drop in the network
efficiency caused by the removal from G of the edges incident in i:
DEglob Eglob(cid:133)G(cid:134)(cid:255)Eglob(cid:133)G0(cid:134)
CI (cid:136) 2 (cid:136) 2 2 , (11)
i Eglob Eglob(cid:133)G(cid:134)
2 2
where by G0 we indicate the network with N points and K(cid:255)k edges obtained by
i
removing from G the edges incident in the node i. Here we use the efficiency defined
in equation (4). However, a generic performance parameter can be used in its place.
The removal of some of the edges affects the communication between some of the
nodes of the graph, thereby increasing the length of the shortest paths. Consequently,
the efficiency of the new graph Eglob(G0) is smaller than Eglob(G). The index CI is
2 2 i
normalized by definition to take values in the interval [0,1]. It can immediately be
seenthat CI is correlatedto all the other three standard centrality indices CD, CC, and
i i i
CB. However, CI also depends on the lengths of the new geodesics, the alternative
i i
paths that are used once the node i is deactivated(cid:246)no information about such new
geodesics is contained in the other indices.
2.5 Space syntax in the field of centrality: integration andCC
The network approach has been broadly used in urban studies. Since the early 1960s
much research has been spent trying to model land uses, market behavior, or traffic
flows on several topological and geometric characteristics of traffic channels (Larson,
1981; Wilson, 2000), or even the exchanges of goods and habitats between historical
settlements in geographic space (Byrd, 1994; Peregrine, 1991; Pitts, 1965; 1979). The
contributionofurbandesignhasbeen mainlytheoretical(Alexander,1998;Batty,2003;
Batty and Longley,1994; Salingaros,1998) with one relevant exception: after the semi-
nal work of Hillier and Hanson (1984), a consistent application of the network
approach to cities, neighbourhoods, streets, and even single buildings has been devel-
oped under the notion of ‘space syntax’, thereby establishing a significant correlation
between the topological accessibility of streets and phenomena as diverse as their
popularity (pedestrian and vehicular flows), human wayfinding, safety against micro-
criminality, retail commerce vitality, activity separation, and pollution (Penn and
Turner, 2003). Though not limited to it alone, the core of the space syntax method-
ology, when applied to street networks, is the integration index, which is stated to be
‘‘so fundamental that it is probably in itself the key to most aspects of human spatial
organization’’ (Hillier,1996, page 33).The integration ofone streethasbeen defined as
the ‘‘shortest journey routes between each link [or space] and all of the others in the
network (defining ‘shortest’ in terms of fewest changes in direction’’ (Hillier, 1998,
page 36). As such, integration turns out to be nothing other than a normalized close-
ness centrality (Jiang and Claramunt, 2004a), the above-mentioned closeness index
The network analysis ofurban streets 711
defined in the early 1950s by structural sociologists and reviewed by Freeman in the
late1970s. A short comparison between formal definitions of integration(cid:246)Hillier and
Hanson(1984,page108),Teklenburget al(1993,page 35),Hillier(1996,page 36),Jiang
and Claramunt (2002, pages 298^299), and many others(cid:246)and that of CC presented
above in equation (7), fully confirms the assumption.
3 Primal versus dual: the 1-square-mile research
Networks of streets and intersections can be represented by spatial graphs in which
zero-dimensional geographic entities (such as intersections) are turned into zero-
dimensional graph entities (nodes) placed into a two-dimensional Euclidean space,
and one-dimensional geographic entities (such as streets) are turned into one-dimen-
sional graph entities (edges or links). Because of the coherence between the dimension
of geographic and graph entities, this kind of representation is hereby termed ‘direct’,
or primal; analogously, representations in which streets are turned into nodes and
intersections are turned into edges, are hereby defined ‘indirect’, or dual(cid:246)that is, the
case of conventional space syntax analysis (Hillier, 1996; Hillier and Hanson, 1984).
The network analysis, applied to territorial cases, has mostly followed a primal
approach, which seems to be the most intuitive for systems in which distance has to
be measured not just in topological terms (steps)(cid:246)such as, for instance, in social
systems(cid:246)but rather in spatial terms (meters), such as in urban street systems. Traffic
engineers and economic geographers or even geoarcheologists have mostly, if not
always, followed the primal approach.The primal approach is also the world standard
in geospatial dataset construction and diffusion: to date, an immense amount of
information has been marketed already following the road-centerline-between-nodes
rule, such as the huge TIGER (topologically integrated geographic encoding and
referencing) database developed at the US Census Bureau. It might appear paradox-
ical, though, that space syntax, the flagship application of urban design, led in the
opposite direction, being based on a dual representation of urban street patterns. In
this representation, axial lines that representgeneralized streets (more exactly:‘lines of
sight’or‘linesofunobstructedmovement’alongmappedstreets)areturnedintonodes,
and intersections between pairs of axial lines are turned into edges. Shortcomings as
well as benefits of this approach have been often remarked (Batty, 2004a; 2004b;
Crucitti et al, 2006; Desyllas and Duxbury, 2001; Hillier and Penn, 2004; Jiang and
Claramunt, 2002, Ratti, 2004).

Recently we addressed a systematic evaluation of different centrality indices distribu-

those cases [figure1(a)^(d), panel1, over], namely Ahmedabad, Venice, Richmond,
CA, and Walnut Creek, CA, arehere given closer focus in order toframe the compar-
ison between the primal and the dual approach. Moreover, whereas Ahmedabad and
Venice are typical self-organized patterns, in that they ‘spontaneously’emerged from a
historical process outside of any central coordination, Richmond and Walnut Creek
are planned patterns, developed following one coordinating layout in a relatively short
periodoftime.Intheprimalapproachcentralityscoresarecalculatedonnodesoverthe

road-centerline-between-nodes rule: real intersections areturned into graph nodes and
real streets are turned into graph edges; all graph edges are defined by two nodes (the
endpoints of the arc) and, possibly, several vertices (intermediate points of linear
discontinuity); intersections among edges are always located at nodes; edges follow

calculated metrically. After the computation of centrality scores on primal nodes,
analogous primal layouts (red-and-blue maps) are produced with reference either to
node or edge centrality; in the latter case, because in the primal graph one edge is
defined by just one pair of ending nodes by which the edge ‘participates’ in the
topology of the network as a whole, centrality on one edge is simply equated to

In the dual approach centrality scores are calculated on nodes over the dual graph
[figure1(a)^(d), panel 3]; here, streets are turned into nodes and intersections are
turnedintoedgesofthedualgraph;thedistancebetweentwonodes(streets)isequated
to the number of intervening edges (intersections) along the shortest connecting path:
it is atopological, nonmetric concept ofdistance which accounts for how many ‘steps’
onenodeispositionedfromanother,nomatterthelengthofthosesteps.Subsequently,
color-coded primal layouts (red-and-blue maps) are drawn from the dual graph, in
which, because nodes in the dual graph represent streets, the centrality scores of a
dual node are associated with the corresponding street in the primal layout. Beside
some dissimilarities, including a different generalization model, this is a conventional
space-syntax approach.
3.2 Generalized versus direct graph representation
A key question in the dual representation of street patterns is whether a ‘principle of
continuity’canbefoundtoextendtheidentityofastreetoverapluralityofedges;thiscan
be referred to as a problem of ‘generalization’. A generalization model is a process of
complexity reduction used by cartographers when reducing the scale of a map; in a first
step,thisisbasedonmergingsinglestreetsegmentsintolonger‘strokes’(Thomson,2004).
Inspacesyntaxresearch,axialmappingactsasageneralization modelinwhichthe
principle of continuity is the linearity of the street spaces [figure 2, row (a), over].
However, Batty and Rana (2002) found nine different methodologies for axial map-
ping, each generating different results, which pose a problem of subjectivity. Jiang and
Claramunt, after a first primal attempt based on characteristic nodes and visibility
(Jiang and Claramunt, 2002), have recently proposed a dual model under a ‘named-
street approach’ (Jiang and Claramunt, 2004a; 2004b) in which the principle of
continuity is the street name [figure 2, row (b)]: two different arcs of the original
network are assigned the same street identity if they share the same street name.The
main problem with this approach is that it introduces a nominalistic component in a
pure spatial context, which results in a loss of coherence of the process as a whole:
streetnamesarenotalwaysmeaningful norreliable,and street-namedatabasesarenot
always available in all cases or at all scales; moreover, the process of embedding and
updating street names into geographical information systems seems rather costly for
large datasets.
In building our dual graphs, we introduce a generalization model based on a
different principle of continuity, one of ‘good continuation’ (Thomson, 2004), which
is based on the preference to go straight at intersections, a well-known cognitive
property of human wayfinding (Conroy Dalton, 2003; Dalton, 2001; Dalton et al,
2003). The model [figure 2, row (c)], which we term intersection continuity negotiation
(ICN), ispurelyspatial inthe sensethatitexcludes anything thatcannotbe derivedby
the sole geometric analysis of the primal graph itself. ICN runs in three steps:
(1)Allnodesareexaminedinturn,beginningatrandom.Ateachnodethecontinuityof
streetidentityisnegotiatedamongallpairsofincidentedges:thetwoedgesformingthe
largest convex angle are assigned the highest continuity and are coupled together;
the two edges with the second largest convex angle are assigned the second largest
continuity and are coupled together, and so forth; in nodes with an odd number of
edges, the remaining edge is given the lowest continuity value.
(2) A streetidentification code is assigned to the edge and, atrelevantintersections,to
the adjacent edges coupled in the first step.

available and continuously updated in this format. The approaches shown in rows (c) and (d)
were the formatsused for the dual and primal cases, respectively, in the presentresearch.

eliminated.The main scope of ICN, in this context, is to make itpossible to derive the
dual case from the same source graph of the primal, which allows comparison.

tance for the human cognitive experience of spaces (Penn, 2003)(cid:246)for any human
sensorial experience of space (Hall, 1966): distance. No matter its real length, one
street will be represented in the dual graph as one point. Moreover, as long as
a generalization model is run and the ‘identity’ of one real street is extended over a
conceptuallyunlimitednumberofrealintersections,inthedualgraphonenode(street)
can exhibit a conceptually unlimited number of edges (intersections), a number which
The network analysis ofurban streets 715
heavilydependsonthelengthofthestreet.Thus,thelongerthestreetinreality,themore
central (by degree) it is likely to be in the dual graph, which counters the experiential
concept of accessibility that is conversely related to how close a destination is to all
origins, such as in transportation models. Moreover, the dual-generalized reduction
makes it impossible to account for the variations that so often characterize one
generalized street, variations that may become very significant for lengthy streets that
cross large urban areas; this is the case, for instance, for the via Etnea in Catania,
Sicily, a roughly 3 km long, perfectly straight 17th-century street that runs from the
baroque city core to the countryside beneath the Etna volcano, a street that exhibits
radicallydifferentsocial,economic,demographic,andenvironmentalconditionsacross
seemingly all possible urban landscapes on Earth.
In more structural terms metric distance has been recognized as the key feature of
road networks, which, exactly because of this fact, need to be dealt with as a new,
specific family of networks (Gastner and Newman, 2004); the crucial nature of geo-
graphic Euclidean distance at the core of such systems leads to other key features,
namelytheplanar natureandtheextremelyreducedvarianceofanode’sdegree,whose
distribution can neverrecall any particularscale-freebehavior. However, as mentioned
above,whenprocessedthroughthedualrepresentationandageneralization model,the
same road network is freed ofsuch limitations: the loss ofanylimitation to the degree
of a node in the dual graph makes the dual-generalized street systems structurally
analogous to all other topological systems recently investigated in other fields, systems
which in fact do not exhibit any geographic constraint; this leads, for instance, to the
recognition of scaling rules in the degree distribution (Jiang and Claramunt, 2004a;
Rosvall et al,2005). Hence, the dual representation and the generalization model(cid:246)the
two pillars of the space-syntax castle(cid:246)actually push urban street systems, in strict
structural terms, out of the geographic domain. Though other means can be investi-
gated in order to introduce geographic distance into such a dual representation (Batty,
2004b;Salheen,2003;SalheenandForsyth,2001),ifaroletogeographicdistancehasto
berecognizedinastraightandplain mannertheprimalroad-centerline-between-nodes
representation of street patterns appears the most valuable option.
3.4 Manycentrality indices, or how to overcome the CC border effect
Implemented on primal graphs, the spatial flow of CC is dominated by the so-called
‘border effect’, in the sense that higher CC scores consistently group around the geo-
metric center of the image. To some extent less evident in less dense cases such as
Walnut Creek, the border effect is overwhelming in denser urban fabrics such as those
of Ahmedabad and Venice [figures 3 and 4(a) (over)]. However, in all cases the border
effect affects CC spatial flow enough to disable the emergence both of central routes
and of focal spots in the city fabric(cid:246)a crucial feature for urban analysis(cid:246)such that it
leads to results which are, to a large extent, meaningless.
Though the border effect dominates the primal representation, it is somehow
minimized in the dual approach [figure 4(b) (over)], owing to the combined impact
both of the loss of metrics and, on the other hand, of the generalization model, which
makesthenetworklessfragmented.Insodoing,thegeneralizationmodelactuallyplays
avital role in that it allows us to limit, to some extent, the border effect. On the other
hand, the identification of continuous routes across the urban fabric is performed
before centrality analysis rather than being one of its outcomes: as such, the results
of centrality analysis get deeply affected by principles that do not belong to any
concept of centrality, but belong rather to the algorithm embedded in the general-
ization model (straightness at intersections in ICN, uninterrupted linearity in axial
mapping, or others).Thus our dual analysis, like that of space syntax, can be referred

toasthecombinedresultoftwodiverseandautonomousrationales,thefirstdrivesthe
generalization process, andthe second drives the spatialflowofcentrality.This finding
confirms that of a previous work in which a conventional space-syntax dual analysis,
appliedwithoutanygeneralization modelon a segmentallyrepresented streetnetwork,
was found to be misleading for the overwhelming impact of the border effect (Dalton
et al, 2003). Again, this effect is not due to some hidden structure of the urban
phenomenon, but to the inherent character of the chosen index: integration, or CC, is
quite affected by theborder effect as a resultof its deep-seated nature; it does notlead
by itself to any legible description of urban routes or focal areas unless the system
is artificially defragmented throughout a generalization process and the study area is
widened in order to leave the most border-affected parts out of the picture, which
seems a scarcely efficient(cid:246)though truly effective(cid:246)solution.
In the light of this evidence one has two options. The first option: we can persist
with the dual-generalized approach [figure 2, rows (a)^(c)] and stress to its limits the
empowerment of the generalization model(cid:246)that is, by automating axial mapping
in the new field of ‘visibility analysis’ (Batty, 2001; 2004a; 2004b; Batty and Rana,
2002; Carvalho and Batty, 2004; Dalton et al, 2003; Fisher-Gewirtzman et al, 2005;

much finer characterization of even the longest streets; to abandon generalization
models, with a relevant advantage in process feasibility, objectivity, and legibility; to
access endless readily available and constantly updated information resources. This
approach would also lead to a great enhancement in the realism of calculations and
representations, in the sense that it pairs the topological properties with the metric
properties of the system, thus comprehending both the cognitive and the proxemic
dimension of collective behaviors in space. These are evidently striking benefits. But
there is one problem and one question.
The problem: as we have just shown, the CC integration index simply does not
work on such primal graphs because CC is vulnerable to the border effect; moreover,
primalgraphsaremuch morefragmentedthandualgeneralized.ButCC isnottheonly
option(cid:246)centrality is a multifold concept and we have many indices at hand.Thus, to
overcome this problem we can limit the analysis of CC to a local scale, at which it
maintains a good potential (figure 3), and simplybegin to test other centrality indices,
suchasthepreviouslymentionedCB,CS,andCI.Areviewofourfindingsisofferedin
the next section.
The question: we know that the more general stream of the network analysis of
complex real-world systems has found a particular scale-free order recursively emerg-
ing in the distribution of node degree centrality CD, and we also know that in our
primal approach to streetsystems we face a strong limitation ofthe same CD range of
variance to scores between 3 and 6 (roughly the number of streets per intersection in
real urban patterns); is the primal approach therefore pushing the network analysis of
road systems out of the larger domain of the‘newsciences of networks’? Again, CD is
also not the only option(cid:246)we will show that, once the analysis of the statistical
distribution of centrality over the network is extended from CD to the other centrality
indices, consistent scaling behaviors come to light that provide a much deeper insight
into the complex nature of real street networks (and into geographic systems in
general).

4 Spatial flow and statistical distribution of centrality indices
Differences and correlations among the many indices of centrality in social networks
have been investigated in a significant flurry of literature over the last decades (Bell
et al, 1999; Bolland, 1988; Cook et al, 1983; Donninger, 1986; Markovsky et al, 1988;
Mullen et al, 1991; Nakao, 1990; Poulin et al, 2000; Rothenberg et al, 1995; see, for
a review,Wasserman and Faust,1994). The goal was to understand the real nature of
those indices when applied to human groups or organizations. The implementation
of centrality indices in territory-related cases(cid:246)though not always geographic(cid:246)has
been, in this respect, much less tested, with some exceptions (Byrd, 1994; Faust et al,
1999;Irwin,1978;Irwin-Williams,1977;Peregrine,1991;Pitts,1965;1979;Rothman,1987;
Smith and Timberlake, 1995). In space syntax, for instance, the link between the
CCintegration core index (as well as the ancillary CDconnectivity index) and centralities
insocialnetworkshasbeenonlyveryrecentlyacknowledged(HillierandIida,2005;Jiang
andClaramunt,2004b),thusthereisapparentlyapoorcomparisonwithotherfamiliesof
centrality indices.
The network analysis ofurban streets 719
Our primal studies on 1-square-mile samples of urban street networks (Crucitti
et al, 2006) reveal that the four families of centrality(cid:246) ‘being near’ (CC), ‘being
between’ (CB), ‘being direct (CS), and ‘being critical’ (CI)(cid:246)exhibit highly diverse
spatial flow patterns [figure 4(a)]. In this sense two conclusions occur. On one hand,
no single index gives the whole picture, as they tell strikingly different stories; on the
other hand, CI emerges as the most comprehensive single index of the whole set, and
gathers properties of all the other indices that we have taken into consideration
(section 2.4).Viewed in greater detail, CC (performed globally) fails to individuate a
hierarchy of central routes or areas and is therefore of no help in urban analysis: the
border effect overwhelms it unless the system itself is isolated in the urban context,
such that borders carry a real territorial meaning (an island, an external campus, a
hamlet in the desert, etc); CB is mostly effective in letting centrality emerge along even
lengthier urban routes, but is still being affected, to some extent, by the border effect;
CS gives themostunexpectedresults,clearlymappingareasofhighercentralityaswell
as central routes, and has no apparent problems with the border effect; CI nicely
captures the criticality of edges that play a ‘bridging’ role in keeping the network
connected, and at the same time partially retains the behavior of CB. In general, the
particular effectiveness of the analysis to account for the variations in centrality levels
within the same route, as in the case of CB in Venice, CS in Ahmedabad, or CI in
Richmond, should be highlighted, especially considering that those routes emerge
‘naturally’ as a pure convergence of centrality across street segments, without any
exogenousinterventionofrationalesofadifferentkind,suchasthatofageneralization
model. As such, MCA suggests that centrality can play a distinct role in the ‘organic’
formation of a ‘skeleton’ of most practiced routes as the cognitive framework for
wayfinding in a complex urban environment (Kuipers et al, 2003).
In figure 4(b) an analogous assessment of a dual-generalized representation of the
same cases is presented. The analysis of CC gives one good result, which is for
Ahmedabad; however, it clearly appears to be affected by the border effect as the
street pattern, as in the case of Venice, becomes more fragmented. The ICN-driven
construction of generalized streets, which is preliminary to the process of centrality
calculation, deeply impacts on the final results in all cases, and leads to a more
artificial picture of real systems and to less differentiated information among indices.
Although in the primal approach continuous routes or subareas emerge in the urban
fabric as a resultofthe natural‘convergence’ofcentralityover a chain ofsingle streets
across a number of intersections, in the dual approach we have routes that are identi-
fied before centralityenters the scene and arethen attributed avalue ofcentrality.This
leads to less univocal results, in the sense that it is impossible to distinguish the actual
centralityofa single street from thatofthe whole generalizedunit (named street, axial
line, etc) with which it has been associated in the course of the generalization process.
The primal representations display consistent behaviors for the same index
across both cases, though different behaviors emerge for different indices (figure 5,
top panel, see over). P(CC) and P(CS) are mainly linear; P(CB) has a single scale
and the dashed lines in the linear^logarithmic plot show an exponential distribution

law that would better represent each distribution, the deviation from the analytic
curves is often very large. In short, the statistical analysis of centrality distributions
on primal graphs confirms that the cumulative distributions of CC, CB, CS, and CI
consistentlyfollowcharacteristicbehaviours;aninterestingresultcomesfromCI,which
is distributed according to an exponential curve for planned cities, whereas for
self-organized cities it follows a power law.
Homogeneity and heterogeneity in the allocation ofthe centrality ‘resource’among
nodes, investigated by the calculation of the Gini coefficient (Dagum, 1980) of each
centrality distribution, have been demonstrated to be sufficient for a broad classifica-
tion ofdifferentcitiesthroughaclusteranalysis thatgroupstogethercitieswithsimilar
urban patterns (Crucitti et al, 2006). This confirms that, by means of the primal
representation and a set of different centrality indices, it is possible to capture basic
crucialpropertiesofrealurbanstreetsystemsforanappropriateclassificationofcities.
Contrary to the case of the primal approach, in dual-generalized graphs the
statistical distribution of CD is a relevant feature because the number of intersections
per street is conceptually unlimited. However, centrality analysis is hereby extended to
the other centrality indices (figure 5, bottom panel), and reveals that, as in the primal
representation,CC andCS haveanS-shapeddistributioninthedualapproach,CB and
CI seem to follow many-scale distributions for Ahmedabad and single-scale distribu-
tions for Richmond. Nevertheless, in the dual-generalized analysis, distributions are
much less clear than in the primal analysis (notice for instance the deviation from the
analytic fit in the CI of Ahmedabad), thereby confirming once more that the primal
representation has a greater capability to extract such hidden order from urban
patterns.
5 Conclusions: benefits of the primal approach and multiple centrality assessment
A network analysis of four 1-square-mile samples of urban street systems has been
performed over primal and dual graphs. The results show that it is possible to dis-
tinguish between homogeneous and heterogeneous patterns(cid:246)that is, planned versus
self-organized cities(cid:246)although it is worth noting that the particular dimensional
limitations of the chosen samples suggest we may have to wait for conclusive con-
siderations. However, within the limits of this study, findings strongly support the
primal approach as a more comprehensive, objective, realistic, and feasible method-
ology for the network analysis of geographic systems such as those of streets and
intersections. Being based on a world standard data format, the primal approach is
suitablefor makingthebestuseofhugeinformationresourcesdevelopedandavailable
in abroad varietyof different fields.This, in turn, significantly reduces subjectivism(cid:246)
and enhances feasibility(cid:246)in data processing by excluding the implementation of any
generalization model. Although, in the dual-generalized approach, centrality statistical
distributions, aside from the case of CD in systems of relevant size, exhibit curves that
significantly deviate from analytical fits, such rules clearly and consistently emerge in
the primal approach. In particular, scaling behaviors emerge for CI in self-organized
urban patterns, whereas in planned patterns they do not(cid:246)a feature which parallels
some of the major achievements in the studyof nongeographic self-organized complex
systems to date.This seems to be inherently linked to what is by far the most relevant
difference between the primal and the dual approaches: whereas the primal approach
allows a metric computation ofdistance without abandoning thetopologyofthe system,
thedual-generalizedapproachleadstoonlyatopologicalcomputationofdistance,which
makesindicesandprocessesfundamentallymoreabstract,inthesensethattheyappearto
miss a relevant part of the causal factors of collective behaviors in space.

Knowledge management in general has received a great deal of attention both in practice and in academic
research. Technology continues to explode, and the ability to tap new sources of data has led to many interesting
developments in the application of supply chain analytics. Technological developments such as cloud computing
and RFID technology have enabled supply chain management to operate on a global basis across firms located
around the globe.
Table 2 gives a recapitulation of what we have found. There are many papers in the data mining and
forecasting literature for specific methodologies and applications. The papers reviewed here were the only ones
selected by the search engine including both supply chain management and data mining, but a wealth of other
related papers could be found by interested researchers. There were 97 papers on SCOPUS reflecting both
“supply chain management” and “data mining.” However, there were many papers with overlapping topics, as
indicated by the last column of Table 2.
Table 2 demonstrates a wide variety of application areas found in this literature review. Data mining is a
technical component of the field of knowledge management, and big data is a related topic focusing on the flood
of data currently generated by our culture. This review establishes that all functions of supply chain management
are supported by some aspect of data mining. The counts are not viewed as reflecting anything useful – simply
which papers mentioned with term. One cannot anticipate all future applications, so looking for gaps in
coverage isn’t really productive. Future innovations will come from understanding the potential of data mining
and related technologies, utilizing cross-fertilization of ideas without constraint for any one view of
classification. Future research will follow new innovations.
Data mining is not a cure-all for all supply chain operations. It has its limits. Data mining philosophy
emphasizes the gaining of slight improvements through more responsive and accurate classification or
prediction. There will always be errors, Type I and Type II. But the idea is to harness the wealth of data currently
available in order to gain some slight advantage, often temporary and specific.
The future of data mining continues to look promising. Supply chains are here to stay, as they have been for
millennia. Computer technology is much more recent. The application of this computer technology to generate
measurements of important aspects of supply chains, and to analyze this data to make better decisions, will
continue to grow.

Published first: 30-06-2020
Abstract – The use of data mining in supply chains is growing, and covers almost all aspects of supply chain
management. A framework of supply chain analytics is used to classify data mining publications reported in supply chain
management academic literature. Scholarly articles were identified using SCOPUS and EBSCO Business search engines.
Articles were classified by supply chain function. Additional papers reflecting technology, to include RFID use and text
analysis were separately reviewed. The paper concludes with discussion of potential research issues and outlook for future
development.
Keywords: Data mining; Supply Chain Management; Review paper
1. Introduction
Supply Chain Analytics (SCA) refers to the use of data and quantitative tools and techniques to
improve operational performance (Handfield 2006, Davis-Sramek et al. 2010). Analytics in supply chain
management (SCM) is not necessarily a new idea (Davenport and O'Dwyer 2011), since various
quantitative techniques and modeling methods have long been used in manufacturing firms. The recent
surge of interest in SCA is accompanied by new challenges and opportunities in both business and
information technology (IT) environments. These challenges include issues arising from managing large
amounts of data (e.g., data availability, data quality) and dealing with environmental uncertainties
(Handfield and Nichols 2004, Liberatore and Luo 2010, Lavalle et al. 2011).
IT is an important corollary to SCA. IT-based innovations have generated and captured more data
while also changing the nature of businesses (Kohli and Grover 2008). The opportunity to gain
competitive advantage may thus arise from how firms manage data (Forslund and Jonsson 2007). Another
major challenge for businesses is the increasing uncertainty in both demand (e.g., consumer market) and
supply sides of their businesses. Dealing with demand and supply uncertainty by means of proper supply
chain planning has been a major theme in many recent SCM studies (Oliva and Watson 2011, Demirkan
and Delen 2012).
This paper classifies supply chain applications of data mining, big data, and other forms of knowledge
management across all functions of supply chains. The diversity of applications is widespread, and is
expected to grow with the growth of technology. The paper also looks at additional reported applications
more general than specific supply chain functions, highlighting technology in the form of RFID
application, and special data mining tools to include text mining.
Data mining is a key component of business analytics, although there is much more to business analytics than
the data mining component. We first define terms and their relationships. We then provide our view of supply
chain management, and how business analytics (and specifically data mining) have been reported in academic
literature. We also discuss technology development and categorize research addressing its role in supporting

supply chain management. The paper concludes with a review of how we see trends in development, and
problems and opportunities in the further use of business analytics (focusing on data mining) in supply chains.
2. Framework for Analysis
This paper uses definition of terms, noting that many others have differing specifics although what is
presented is compatible with most, at least at the higher levels. Knowledge management is a high level
concept, which Chae et al. (2014) define as consisting of access to data and its management along with
analytics. INFORMS (Robinson et al. 2010) gives the concise definition: “Analytics facilitates realization
of business objectives through reporting of data to analyze trends, creating predictive models for
forecasting and optimizing business processes for enhanced performance.” Sathi (2012) gives two
common sources of data grouped under the banner of Big Data - data within the corporation that, thanks
to automation and access, is increasingly shared, and data from outside the organization - some available
publicly free of cost, some based on paid subscription, and the rest available selectively for specific
business partners or customers. Big data provides the opportunity to monitor many more things at a much
more detailed level.
Knowledge Management is used here as an umbrella term, including subsets of applications useful to
the supply chain firm (process management, etc.), the information systems needed to provide information
for supply chain management, data sources, and the broad field of analytics. Table 1 displays these
relationships.

SCA has been proposed as a promising approach to better manage data, utilize information technology (IT)
resources, and prepare for effective supply chain planning. This new generation of analytic tools can develop a
firm’s IT and data management capabilities to enhance planning and improve operational performance (Mithas
et al. 2011). It is suggested that firms can use SCA from data acquisition (e.g., RFID) and repository (e.g., ERP)
technologies to improve supply chain planning through IT-enabled planning and scheduling systems (O'Dwyer
and Renner 2011).
Chae et al. (2014) took a theoretical perspective of SCA as a combination of three sets of data and IT-enabled
supply chain management resources, to include data management resources (DMR), IT-based supply chain
planning resources (IPR), and performance management resources (PMR). Manufacturing firms acquire and use
various IT and organizational resources in these three aspects of SCA. DMR includes IT-related resources (e.g.,
RFID, ERP) and analytical capabilities (e.g., mathematical optimization techniques) for data acquisition and
management. IPR indicates the level of sophistication of IT resources used for supply chain planning. PMR
refers to a set of data-oriented resources focusing on improving manufacturing process performance, such as
statistical process control and Six Sigma, among others.

The three subsequent subsections deal with papers covering the broader context of knowledge
management, big data, and specific supply chain functions. Knowledge Management and Big Data
sections are shorter because the focus is on specific supply chain functions supported by data mining.
2.1. Knowledge Management Papers
Overview papers related to data analytics and/or knowledge management within supply chains discuss
conceptual views of how knowledge management supports supply chains. Collins et al. (2010) gave an
historical review of supply chain development along with a list of supply chain measures in the context of
overall firm strategy. They found that by capturing data and mining it, firms could better identify
environmental changes and to develop strategies for successful coping. Chae et al. (2014) analyzed the
effectiveness of SCA in leading to greater manufacturing effectiveness. Banerjee et al. (2013) reported
that state of the art of data analysis in India with respect to supply chain management as well as other
areas. Choudhary et al. (2011) gave a specific system to support knowledge acquisition, learning, and
updating within supply chains. Qin and Zhao (2012) discussed how cloud computing can aid supply chain
information management.
2.2. Big Data Papers
Big data has become endemic in our society. New regulatory requirements on food safety and tracking in the
European Union and in the US are driving development of data platforms and advanced analytics throughout the
supply chain (Dobbs et al. 2015). It is important in supply chain management because of a number of sources of
data. RFID and bar-coding generate a great deal of data. Chae (2015) examined the role of social media
platforms in generating big data useful within supply chains. Ivanov and Sokolov (2012) provided an inter-
disciplinary modeling framework for model-based decision support within collaborative supply chains. Sensors
and transaction logs within organizations, as well as Internet linkages both from fellow supply chain participants
as well as from other Internet sources have led to an explosive growth in big data, which can be valuable to track
materiel by location, and can be useful for supply chain planning.
Tien (2012) argued for big data as an enabler for mass customization of goods and/or services, leading to
simultaneous real-time management of supply and demand chains by supply chain participants. This was
contended to provide overwhelming economic advantage to industrialized countries where consumers can
influence producers through big data feedback. Schlegel (2014/2015) discussed big data and predictive analytics
as strategic tools to mitigate risk within supply chains, utilizing the Internet-of-things and data mining to better
forecast demand. Schoenherr and Speier-Pero (2015) reviewed academic programs that have evolved to train
university students in supply chain data science (predictive analytics and big data).
2.3. Supply Chain Functions
Supply chain operations include many functions. A list of typical activities, not intended to be
comprehensive, but representative:
Supply Chain Functions
o Forecasting
o Product development
▪ Profiling customer relationship management
o Supplier selection
o Inventory management Order batching
o Logistics
o Quality management
This bullet list will be used as a framework for sorting out published articles related to data mining within
supply chains. Fraud detection is a function that might appear in a specific supply chain, but not necessarily in
all. Risk management is a comprehensive dimension to all aspects of supply chain management. We encountered
papers in these additional areas as well as the core supply chain functions.
17
Journal of Supply Chain Management Science, Vol. 1, No 1-2 (2020)
3. Supply Chain Function Papers
The initial source of papers were obtained from search engines EBSCO Business Premier and SCOPUS,
using search terms “supply chain management” and “data mining.” SCOPUS provided about twice as many
returns, with many overlaps. These sources were supplemented by additional searches on specific topics. It is not
possible to obtain a count by category with any meaning, as most articles cover multiple aspects of both
knowledge management as well as of application to different supply chain functions. The review will commence
with the seven categories outlines in section 2.3.
3.1. Forecasting
Forecasting is a well-studied area, long-important in data mining research. Accurately forecasting inventory
replenishment requirements is critical for successful supply chain management (Stefanovic, 2015), and data
mining can be used to do that better. Smith (2011) gave four examples of supply chain management involving
forecasting. Thomassey (2010) gave a widespread example of the need for accurate forecasting in supply chain
environments (in his case, textile apparel). The reported application included complex features such as fuzzy
logic and neural networks, and were evaluated for mitigation of the bullwhip effect by simulation. Shukla et al.
(2012) dealt with the common demand feature of seasonality, specifically investigating unintended cyclic
variability from endogenous disturbances. Ability to identify these early would have obvious benefits to supply
chain participants. This paper again applied advanced techniques, in this case Fourier and discrete wavelet
transforms along with an autoregressive model. The Fourier transform was most effective in the steel supply
network examined in that study. Tirkel (2013) applied forecasting to semiconductor manufacturing flow time
analysis, utilizing data mining processes to include business understanding, data processing, and classification to
forecast flow time, enabling better short-term planning and efficiency.
Related to forecasting is prediction. A prediction may be a statement of an expected outcome, while forecast
is a term often used for generation of a range of possible outcomes. Thomassey (2010) applied fuzzy logic and
neural networks to improve forecasting in a clothing industry application to reduce bullwhip effect. Stefanovic
(2014) used the term “predictive analytics” in his paper encouraging supply chains to be proactive and to apply
data mining for prediction. His business intelligence model included process modeling, performance
measurement, data mining models, and web portal technologies, seeking more intelligent, predictive, and
responsive supply chains.
3.2. Product Development
Product development is a key step in any production operation, and is thus important in many supply chains.
Wang et al. (2004) presented a case-based reasoning model for product development. The paper deals with
knowledge management rather than data mining, but serves as a demonstration of the difference. The tacit design
knowledge of the participants were to be enhanced by the system pulling up past processes and potentially
including support of tacit information. Data mining, conversely, deals more with quantitative analysis.
In the area of data mining, Tien (2006) classified methods used to manage supply and demand chains. They
suggest that simultaneous management of supply and demand can foster mass customization in real-time. Song
and Kusiak (2009) applied mass customization through data mining to obtain rules from historical sales data to
reach compromise between customer preference for greater product diversity with production’s time-honored
emphasis on product line simplification.
In the review of papers, it was apparent that profiling of customers often blends into the same topic as
product development. This seems appropriate in a more service-oriented environment than existed maybe 60
years ago during the heyday of the rust belt (where the focus was on “making things”). Three papers were
originally categorized as product development, but clearly have customer relationship focus. Liao et al. (2008a)
demonstrated use of the a priori algorithm of association rules to map products to customer demands with the
intent of suggesting new products for specific customers. Liao et al. (2008b) added k-means clustering to the a
priori algorithm to mine customer knowledge. Liao and Wen (2009) reported knowledge extraction from a priori
association rules in new product development of bicycles in Taiwan.
18
Journal of Supply Chain Management Science, Vol. 1, No 1-2 (2020)
Data mining has long been applied to customer relationship management. Review of these papers confirms its
continued use, but also show that data mining can be used for more operational level activities in product
development. Min (2006) demonstrated data mining to examine grocery customer behavior and gave a classic
example of loyal customer profiling. Liao et al. (2009) used their a priori/clustering combination to market
segmentation in the Taiwanese life insurance market. Pillutla et al. (2014) analytically mined surveys obtained
from Chinese firms in Suzhou on adoption of e-procurement, enabling them to identify critical drivers for system
adoption. Srivhok and Intrapairot (2014) used classification analysis to study tourist demand in Thailand.
3.3. Supplier Selection
Selecting suppliers seems to be the most commonly analyzed supply chain problem, at least with respect to
data mining. Piramuthu (2005) provided an early framework using machine learning for automated supply chain
configuration, which could be applied in real time over the Internet. Ni et al. (2007) gave a methodology for
supplier selection including quality function deployment, focusing on robust analysis and decision support. Lin
et al. (2009) used association rules to consider thousands of potential suppliers while considering a number of
factors. Parmar et al. (2010) applied cluster analysis to filter suppliers down to more manageable groups. Zhao
and Yu (2011) used case-based reasoning and data mining (for attribute weight calculation in entropy) and
clustering along with back-propagation neural networks in the Chinese petroleum industry. Chen et al. (2012)
reported an integrated model combining k-means clustering and decision trees to overcome limitations of
statistical techniques demonstrated on a manufacturing application. Jain et al. (2014) applied data mining to
identify hidden relationships among supplier pre-qualification data with overall supplier rating based on prior
work to improve supplier selection.
Some research has considered specific multiple criteria aspects (as well as data mining) in supplier selection.
Ha and Krishnan (2008) gave a method incorporating multiple techniques through a combined supplier score
considering multiple dimensions of performance. Hong and Ha (2008) gave a partner assessment system to
monitor supplier performance over time, utilizing machine learning and multiple criteria analysis, and
demonstrated their system in the agricultural industry. Xu and Lin (2009) used analytic hierarchy process along
with association rule mining, using a supplier selection scenario for demonstration.
There also are a number of papers utilizing fuzzy and related approaches. Jain et al. (2007) applied fuzzy
association rule mining for supplier evaluation. Li et al. (2008) proposed grey-based rough sets along with data
mining and rough set theory, arguing that it had relative advantages under conditions of high uncertainty. Jain et
al. (2009) analyzed diverse modeling methods to include fuzzy logic, agent technology, and petri nets for
dynamic supply chain partner configuration. Zou et al. (2011) used rough set theory to derived decision rules for
distributor selection in China. Faezy Razi (2014) used a combination of grey relational analysis and an artificial
bee colony heuristic algorithm to select suppliers under conditions of multiple criteria.
Supplier selection is probably the most popular research topic concerning analytic modeling in supply chain
management. Thus it is expected that there are quite a few data mining papers. These papers appear to apply the
gamut of data mining approaches, as well as knowledge management ideas such as case-based reasoning. These
spill over into multiple criteria and fuzzy papers, of which there are many non-data mining papers in supplier
selection research.
3.4. Inventory Management
Inventory management also has received a great deal of study in the supply chain field. Thus we are not
surprised to find a number of data mining papers applied to inventory management. Song and Dinwoodie (2008)
claimed data mining in their application of ANOVA analysis and stochastic dynamic programming to vendor
management inventory reduction of lead-time. Tsou (2013) developed an autoregressive time series data mining
technique to detect market demand change. Ji et al. (2013) proposed a system gathering data from Internet-of-
things technology, fed into data mining algorithms to control supply chain inventory.
In the field of more traditional data mining tools (classification), Chen and Wu (2005) applied association
rules along with zero-one programming to demand side management of electrical utilities. Delen et al. (2011)
combined data mining models with operations research tools and geographic information systems for a US
Department of Defense funded projects related to blood supply management.
19
Journal of Supply Chain Management Science, Vol. 1, No 1-2 (2020)
Shao et al. (2010) used system dynamics, multi-agent modeling, and complex adaptive systems for
forecasting supplier demand data. Peng et al. (2014) also applied system dynamics, in this case for disaster relief
support to better manage inventory stocking.
Inventory management has long been a staple research topic in operations management, and continues to be
so with the shift to focus on supply chain management. Forecasting has obvious utility, but classification
modeling also is present. Simulation is highly appropriate due to the presence of variance in inventory.
3.5. Logistics
There were fewer papers that directly seemed related to logistics, although this is clearly an important field in
supply chain management. Bhattacharya et al. (2014) reported an application of support vector machines along
with mixed integer programming for intermodal transportation support of traffic flow. Renaud-Gentié et al.
(2014) used multidimensional data analysis for vineyard transportation network analysis in the Loire Valley of
France. Soeanu et al. (2015) used decision trees to model transportation decisions manage transportation risk in
the field of humanitarian aid.
Mathematical programming appears a bit more in logistics papers. Risk aspects are clearly appropriate,
especially in the context of supply chains.
3.6. Quality Management
The emphasis on quality function deployment in operations management makes it a rich field for application.
Zhou et al. (2008) reported effective uses of on-line reputation systems, a form of text analysis, in supporting
market management. Ho et al. (2009) gave a distributed process mining system that they contended would lead
to shorter delivery time, greater flexibility, and higher customer satisfaction. Li et al. (2010) applied a data
mining framework for early warning and proactive control of a food supply chain network. Ting et al. (2014)
used association rules in their decision support system to monitor food quality, using Hong Kong red wine
products as a demonstration application.
Ghadge et al. (2012) utilized text mining to analyze supply chain risk literature, claiming an unbiased and
holistic picture of advances within supply chain risk management.
Text analysis clearly has a role in analyzing customer quality feedback. But analysis of other aspects related
to supply chain quality also are evident.
3.7. Risk Analysis
Supply chains usually involve trading off the control of vertical integration for the opportunities of combining
the core competencies of a number of independent entities, often through outsourcing. Inherently, this loss of
control involves more risk but lower cost. Management of supply chain risk is crucial. Application of supply
chain risk management appeared in a number of articles already classified. Le et al. (2013) specifically applied
association rules to retail supply chain to remove sensitive knowledge from released databases, a common issue
in contemporary collaborative supply chain databases containing sensitive information. Another risk aspect is
fraud detection, widely used in the insurance industry. Kraus and Valverde (2014) discussed data warehouse
design supporting forensic analysis to detect fraud in inventory management and warranty claims, but argued
that the methodology was generalizable to the supply chain management process.
Risk is a component of all aspects of supply chain management, so many risk-related articles appear in prior
categories. The data variability inherent in risk makes simulation or stochastic modeling attractive.
4. Papers Dealing with Related Tools
A number of papers have been published focusing on the technologies enabling application of data mining (or
more generally knowledge management) to supply chains. This section demonstrates one source of technology
support to supply chains in the form of radio-frequency identification (RFID), and then looks at technology
support in the form of data mining methodologies, with specific categorization of text mining.
20
Journal of Supply Chain Management Science, Vol. 1, No 1-2 (2020)
4.1. RFID Papers
RFID offers great potential within supply chains, enabling critically important tracking capabilities that can
greatly improve the efficiency of inventory management, as well as the management of other resources. Key
challenges to the implementation of data mining using RFID data are that different identification numbers across
participating supply chain organizations, and aggregation of data often limit traceability. Furthermore, because
of the multitude of pallets that might be tracked, the sheer dimensionality of tracking is a challenge.
Thiesse et al. (2009) gave fundamental concepts and applications of a system based on Electronic Product
Code that facilitates data exchange within supply chains, and thus enables data mining application. Gonzalez et
al. (2010) addressed the massive data sets generated by RFID within supply chains, and provided a movement
graph model to compactly represent RFID data sets. Lee et al. (2010) proposed a knowledge discovery system to
support customer relationship management based on point-of-sales and historical data as well as RFID data.
Their system queries temporal data interactively and recursively, followed by association rule modeling for
market basket analysis. Yűksel and Yűksel (2011) introduced a middleware to link RFID technology
automatically to supply chain systems. Masciari (2012) presented a system monitoring RFID data for objects
tracked in supply chains. Brandau and Tolujevs (2013) suggested data mining methods to sort through the
massive volumes of state data generated by location and sensor technology. Zhang et al. (2014) presented an
RFID simulation system to evaluate RFID deployment effectiveness in difficult environments, utilizing
regression trees. Yi (2014) gave a graphic-based data mining approach to select useful data from a massive RFID
data stream. Zhu (2014) also gave a graphical mining approach to track objects over a supply chain.
4.2. Data Mining Methodologies
There are widespread uses of data mining to support business (Olson and Shi 2006). Supply chain operations
have been supported by the usual business data mining analyses of classification (to include customer profiling
and fraud detection) and prediction. That implies use of the standard data mining methodologies of logistic
regression, decision trees, and neural networks for classification, and regression for prediction. Clustering was
applied by the National Iranian Oil Company Training Center (Hadighi et al. 2013) to integrate management by
cluster in place of management by objectives. Costa et al. (2014) also reported us of cluster analysis in supply
chains to monitor vehicle traffic management with data obtained from mobile devices. Genetic algorithms are a
specialty tool that can be utilized in some data mining analyses. Ayoub et al. (2007) applied fuzzy clustering
analysis and decision trees, using genetic algorithms to optimize location of biomass collection plants in
bioenergy production in Japan.
Association rules provide a means to initially sort out relationships. Fuzzy analysis recognizes that some data
points (especially subjective input) involves some range of uncertainty. Jain et al. (2008) used fuzzy association
rule mining to help evaluate multiple criteria in agile supply chain decisions. Lau et al. (2009) also applied fuzzy
association rules to capture logics operation data to identify root-causes of quality problems. Shih (2007)
proposed use of multi-criteria field service scheduling in e-service supply chain management, while Ren et al.
(2014) applied fuzzy classification to evaluate supply chain competitiveness.
Another technology often applied is the use of automation in the form of agents. This is especially attractive
when dealing with big data, attempting to automate data gathering and analysis. Warkentin et al. (2012)
suggested opportunities to utilize knowledge discovery through data mining in Web-based electronic commerce.
Balasubramaniam and Thigarasu (2015) used agents in generating decision tree analysis to avoid over-fitting
when measuring supply chain efficiency with respect to both cost and customer satisfaction.
4.3. Text Mining Papers
Data mining extends beyond mere numerical analysis. Text mining extends knowledge management to
language data. Moriizumi et al. (2011) gave an example application for supply chain risk analysis, drawing upon
academic research papers obtained from EBSCO and other search engines. Other papers report use of data
mining tools such as support vector machines and random forests in text mining green supply chain management
literature (Wu and Guo 2012). Sentiment analysis has grown in popularity. Ludwig et al. (2013) gave an
example of analyzing Amazon.com book reviews. Schniederjans et al. (2013) analyzed negative word-of-mouth
21
Journal of Supply Chain Management Science, Vol. 1, No 1-2 (2020)
information obtained from social media and their impact on financial performance. Ordenes et al. (2014)
addressed noted limitations of text mining depth in customer feedback, suggesting an improved methodology.

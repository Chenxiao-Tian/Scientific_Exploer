further research can unpack the relationship between development era, design
paradigm, city size, transportation planning objectives, and street network entropy
to explore how network growth and evolution affect spatial order. Finally, given
the importance of taking multiple indicators in concert, future work can develop a
grid-index to unify them and eventually include streetscape and width attributes as
further enrichment to explore walkability and travel behavior.
Conclusion
Street networks organize and constrain a city’s transportation dynamics according
to a certain spatial logic—be it planned or unplanned, ordered or disordered. Past
studies of this spatial order have been challenged by small samples, limited geog-
raphies, and abstract entropy indicators. This study accordingly looked at a larger
sample of cities around the world, empirically examining street network configur-
ation and entropy across 100 cities for the first time. It measured network
orientation entropy, circuity, connectedness, and grain. It also developed an
orientation-order indicator φ, to quantify the extent to which a network is
ordered according to a single grid.
This study found significant correlations between φ and other indicators of spatial
order, including street circuity and measures of connectedness. It empirically
confirmed that the cities in the US and Canada are more grid-like (exhibiting far less
entropy and circuity) than was typical elsewhere. It is noteworthy that Chicago—the
foremost theoretical model of twentieth century city growth and development in
urban studies (Dear 2001; Park and Burgess 1925; Wirth 1928)—is an extreme outlier
among world cities in terms of spatial orientation-order. In sum, these methods and
indicators demonstrate scalable techniques to empirically measure and visualize the
complexity of spatial order, illustrating patterns in urbanization and transportation
around the world.

examines street network orientation,configuration, and entropyin 100citiesaround
the world using OpenStreetMap data and OSMnx. It measuresthe entropy ofstreet
bearingsin weighted and unweighted network models, along with each city’s typical
street segment length, average circuity, average node degree, and the network’s
proportions of four-way intersections and dead-ends.It also develops a new
indicatorof orientation-order that quantifieshow a city’sstreet network follows the
geometric ordering logic of a single grid. A cluster analysis is performed to explore
similarities and differences among these study sites in multiple dimensions.
Significant statistical relationships exist between city orientation-order and other
indicatorsof spatial order, including street circuity and measures ofconnectedness.
On average, US/Canadian study sites are far more grid-like than those elsewhere,
exhibiting less entropy and circuity. These indicators, taken in concert, help reveal
the extent and nuance ofthe grid. These methods demonstrate automatic, scalable,
reproducible tools to empirically measure and visualize city spatial order, illustrating
complex urban transportation system patterns and configurations around theworld.
Introduction
Spatial networks such as streets, paths, and transit lines organize the human dynamics of
complex urban systems. They shape travel behavior, location decisions, and the texture of
the urban fabric (Jacobs 1995; Levinson and El-Geneidy 2009; Parthasarathi et al. 2015).
Accordingly, researchers have recently devoted much attention to street network patterns,
performance, complexity, and configuration (Barthelemy et al. 2013; Batty 2005a; Boeing
2018a; Buhl et al. 2006; Chan et al. 2011; Ducruet and Beauguitte 2014; Jiang et al. 2014;

tas and Polyzos2018;Wang 2015). Inthesespatialnetworks,entropyhasdeep theoretical

plored the nature of entropy and order in urban street networks, seeking to quantify pat-
terns of spatial order and disorder in urban circulation systems (Gudmundsson and
Mohajeri 2013; Li et al. 2018; Mohajeri et al. 2013a, 2013b; Mohajeri and Gudmundsson

Theories of urban order span sociological frameworks of physical-social dis-
order (e.g., “broken windows” theory), to public health goals of opening-up and
sanitizing pathogenic urban spaces, to city planners’ pursuit of functional differ-
entiation and regulation (Boyer 1983; Hatuka and Forsyth 2005; Mele 2017;
O’Brien et al. 2019; Park and Burgess 1925; Xu 2008). This study considers the
spatial logic and geometric ordering that arise through street network orientation.
A city’s development eras, design paradigms, underlying terrain, culture, and local
economic conditions influence the pattern, topology, and grain of its street net-
works (Jackson 1985; Kostof 1991). These networks in turn structure the human
interactions and transportation processes that run along them, forming an
important pillar of city planners’ quest for spatial order (Rose-Redwood and
Bigon 2018). In particular, network orientation and geometry have played an out-
sized role in urban planning since its earliest days (Smith 2007).
Measuring these network patterns can help researchers, planners, and community
members understand local histories of urban design, transportation planning, and
morphology; evaluate existing transportation system patterns and configurations; and
explore new infrastructure proposals and alternatives. It also furthers the science of cit-
ies by providing a better understanding of urban patterns and how they correspond to
evolutionary mechanisms, planning, and design. However, due to traditional data gath-
ering challenges, this research literature has necessarily relied on small samples, limited
geographies, and abstract indicators. Past studies have typically explored circuity and
entropy in individual or paired case studies—less is known about broader cross-
sectional trends worldwide. How do street network configurations organize and order
urban spaceincities aroundthe world?
This paper addresses this gap by empirically modeling and measuring order and
configuration in 100 city street networks around the world, comprising over 4.8
million nodes and 3.3 million edges. It measures street network orientation
entropy, circuity, connectedness, and grain. It also develops a straightforward new
indicator, the orientation-order φ, to quantify the extent to which a street network
follows the spatial ordering logic of a single grid. It finds significant statistical rela-
tionships between city orientation and other indicators of spatial order (including
street circuity and connectedness). The most common orientation worldwide, even
among cities lacking a strong grid, tends toward north-south-east-west. It also finds
that American cities tend to be far more grid-like and less circuitous than cities
elsewhere. Considered jointly, this collection of indicators helps reveal the extent
and nuance of the grid around the world.
Background
Streetnetworkplanning
The orthogonal grid, the most common planned street pattern, is often traced back to
Hippodamus of Miletus (Mazza 2009; Paden 2001)—whom Aristotle labeled the father of
city planning for his orthogonal design of Piraeus in ancient Greece—but archaeologists
havefoundvestigesinearliersettlementsaroundtheworld(Burns1976;Stanislawski1946).
Mohenjo-Daro in the Indus Valley, dating to 2500BCE, featured a north-south-east-west
orthogonal grid (McIntosh 2007). Ancient Chinese urban design organized capital cities
BoeingAppliedNetworkScience (2019) 4:67 Page3of19
around gridded patterns codified in the Kao Gong Ji, a scientific text from c. 500BCE
(ElmanandKern2009).Teotihuacanfeaturedanoffsetgrid,datingto100BCE,thataligned

RomanEmpireusedstandardizedstreetgridstoefficientlylayoutnewtownsandcolonies
during rapid imperial expansion (Kaiser 2011). Many medieval towns were even planned
around approximate, if distorted, grids possibly to maximize sun exposure on east-west
streetsduringwinter market days(Lilley2001).In1573,King Phillip II ofSpain issuedthe
LawoftheIndies,systematizinghowcolonistssitednewsettlementsanddesignedrectilin-
ear gridded street networks around central plazas (Low 2009; Rodriguez 2005). In the US,
many east coast cities planned their expansions around street grids, including Philadelphia
in 1682, Savannah in 1733, Washington in 1791, and New York in 1811 (Jackson 1985;
Sennett1990).ThesubsequentUSHomesteadActsweepinglyorganizedtheAmericanin-
terioraccordingtothespatiallogicofthegridiron(Boeing2018b).
In the context of urban form, the concept of “spatial order” is fuzzy. Street networks
that deviate from griddedness inherently possess different spatial logics and ordering
principles (Karimi 1997; Southworth and Ben-Joseph 1995, 2004). Cities planned with-
out a grid—as well as unplanned cities that grew through accretion—may lack clearly
defined orientation order, but can still be well-structured in terms of complex human
dynamics and land use (Hanson 1989). Specific visual/geometric order should not be
confused for functional/social order (Roy 2005; Salingaros 1998; Smith 2007). Different
design logics support different transportation technologies and appeal to different cul-
tures anderas(Jackson1985).
The grid has been used to express political power, promote military rule, improve ca-
dastrallegibility,fosteregalitarianism,andencouragelandspeculationanddevelopment
(Ellickson 2013; Groth 1981; Low 2009; Martin 2000; Mazza 2009; Rose-Redwood
2011; Sennett 1990). Many cities spatially juxtapose planned and unplanned districts or
non-binarily intermingle top-down design with bottom-up self-organized complexity.
Old cores maycompriseorganic patternsadjacent tolater gridirons,inturnadjacent to
later winding suburbs. Even previously highly-ordered urban cores can grow in entropy
as later generations carve shortcuts through blocks, reorganize space through infill or
consolidation, and adapt to shifting points of interest—all of which occurred in
medievalRome andBarcelona,forinstance (Kostof1991).
Streetnetworkmodeling
Street networks are typically modeled as graphs where nodes represent intersec-
tions and dead-ends, and edges represent the street segments that link them
(Barthelemy and Flammini 2008; Cardillo et al. 2006; Lin and Ban 2013; Marshall
et al. 2018; Porta et al. 2006). These edges are spatially embedded and have both a
length and a compass bearing (Barthelemy 2011). The present study models urban
street networks as undirected nonplanar multigraphs with possible self-loops. While
directed graphs most-faithfully represent constraints on flows (such as vehicular
traffic on a one-way street), undirected graphs better model urban form by
corresponding 1:1 with street segments (i.e., the linear sides of city blocks). While
many street networks are approximately planar (having relatively few overpasses or
underpasses), nonplanar graphs provide more accurate models by accommodating
BoeingAppliedNetworkScience (2019) 4:67 Page4of19
those bridges and tunnels that do often exist (Boeing 2018c; Eppstein and
Goodrich 2008).
The data to study these networks typically come from shapefiles of digitized streets. In
theUS,theCensusBureauprovidesTIGER/Lineshapefilesofroadsnationwide.Inother
countries, individual municipal, state, or federal agencies may provide similar data, how-
ever,digitizationstandardsanddataavailabilityvary.Accordingly,cross-sectionalresearch
ofstreetnetworkorientationandentropyhastendedtobelimitedtoindividualgeograph-
ical regions or examine small samples. However, today, OpenStreetMap presents a new
alternativedatasource.OpenStreetMapisacollaborativeworldwidemappingprojectthat
includes streets, buildings,amenities, and otherspatial features. Although its data quality
varies somewhat between countries, in general its streets data are high quality, especially
incities(Barrington-Leighand Millard-Ball 2017; Barron etal. 2014; Zielstraetal. 2013).
This data source offers the opportunity to conduct cross-sectional research into street
networkformandconfigurationaroundtheworld.
Recently, scholars have studied street network order and disorder through circu-
ity and orientation entropy. The former measures street curvature and how this re-
lates to other urban patterns and processes (Boeing 2019; Giacomin and Levinson
2015; Levinson and El-Geneidy 2009). The latter quantifies and visualizes the en-
tropy of street orientations to assess how ordered they are (Courtat et al. 2011;
Gudmundsson and Mohajeri 2013; Mohajeri et al. 2013a, 2013b; Mohajeri and
Gudmundsson 2012, 2014), as entropy quantifies the fundamentally related con-
cepts of disorder, uncertainty, and dispersion. Louf and Barthelemy (2014) explore
city block geometries around the world as a function of block size and form factor,
clustering them to identify differences between US and European cities. However,
less is known about cross-sectional trends in the spatial orientation and ordering
of street networks worldwide. This study builds on this prior research into circuity,
order, and entropy by drawing on OpenStreetMap data to examine cities around
the world and explore their patterns and relationships.

of high population, regional significance, and some stratification to ensure geographical
diversity within regions. Accordingly, this sample comprises a broad cross-section of dif-
ferent histories, cultures, development eras, and design paradigms. Of course, no single
consistent definition of “city” or its spatial jurisdiction exists worldwide as these vary be-
tween countries for historical and political reasons. We aim for consistency by trying to
useeachstudysite’sclosestapproximationofa“municipality”forthecitylimits.Thelone
exception is Manhattan, where we focus on one borough’s famous grid instead of the
amalgamofboroughsthatcomposeNewYorkCity.
Once these study sites are defined, we use the OSMnx software to download the
street network within each city boundary and then calculate several indicators.
OSMnx is a free, open-source, Python-based toolkit to automatically download
BoeingAppliedNetworkScience (2019) 4:67 Page5of19
spatial data (including municipal boundaries and streets) from OpenStreetMap and
construct graph-theoretic objects for network analysis (Boeing 2017).
Analysis
For each city, we calculate the street network’s edges’ individual compass bearings with
OSMnx using two different methods. The first method simplifies the topology of each
graph such that nodes exist only at intersections and dead-ends; edges thus represent
street segments (possibly curving, as full spatial geometry is retained) between them
(ibid.). In this method, the bearing of edge e equals the compass heading from u to v
uv
andits reciprocal (e.g.,ifthebearing from utovis90° then weadditionallyaddabear-
ing of 270° since the one-dimensional street centerline points in both directions). This
captures the orientation of street segments but ignores the nuances of mid-block
curvature. To address this, the second method does not simplify the topology: edges
represent OpenStreetMap’s raw straight-line street segments, either between intersec-
tions or in chunks approximating curving streets. This method weights each edge’s
bearing by length to adjust for extremely short edges in these curve-approximations. In
both methods,self-loopingedges haveundefinedbearings, which areignored.
Oncewehavecalculatedallofthebearings(andtheirreciprocals)foralltheedgesina
city, we divide them into 36 equal-sized bins (i.e., each bin represents 10°). To avoid ex-
tremebin-edgeeffectsaroundcommonvalueslike0°and90°,weshifteachbinby−5°so
thatthesevaluessitatthecentersoftheirbinsratherthanattheiredges.Thisallowssimi-
lar common bearings such as 359.9° and 0.1° to fall in the same bin as each other. Once
the bearings are binned, we calculate the Shannon entropy, Η, of the city’s orientations’
distribution (Shannon 1948). For each city’s graph, we first calculate the entropy of the
unweighted/simplifiedstreetorientations,Η ,as:
o
X
Η ¼− n PðoÞ log PðoÞ ð1Þ
o i¼1 i e i
where n represents the total number of bins, i indexes the bins, and P(o) represents
i
the proportion of orientations that fall in the ith bin. We similarly calculate the entropy
oftheweighted/unsimplified street orientations,Η ,as:
w
X
Η ¼− n PðwÞ log PðwÞ ð2Þ
w i¼1 i e i
where n represents the total number of bins, i indexes the bins, and P(w) represents
i
the proportion of weighted orientations that fall in the ith bin. While Η is biased by
w
thecity’sshape (duetolength-weighting),Η isnot.
o
The natural logarithm means the value of Η is in dimensionless units called
“nats,” or the natural unit of information. The maximum entropy, Η , that any
max
city could have equals the logarithm of the number of bins: 3.584 nats. This rep-
resents the maximum entropy distribution, a perfectly uniform distribution of
street bearings across all bins. If all the bearings fell into a single bin, entropy
would be minimized and equal 0. However, given the undirected graph, the min-
imal theoretical entropy a street network could have (e.g., if all of its streets ran
only north-south, thus falling evenly into two bins) would be 0.693 nats. But
given the nature of the real world, a more plausible minimum would instead be
an idealized city grid with all streets in four equal proportions (e.g., north-south-
BoeingAppliedNetworkScience (2019) 4:67 Page6of19
east-west). This perfect grid entropy, Η , would equal 1.386 nats. Therefore, we
g
can calculate a normalized measure of orientation-order, φ, to indicate where a
city stands on a linear spectrum from completely disordered/uniform to perfectly
ordered/grid-like as:
(cid:2) (cid:3)
Η −Η 2
φ¼1− o g ð3Þ
Η −Η
max g
Thus, a φ value of 0 indicates low order (i.e., perfect disorder and maximum entropy
with a uniform distribution of streets in every direction) and a φ value of 1 indicates
high order (i.e., a single perfectly-ordered idealized four-way grid and minimal possible
entropy). Note that the value is squared to linearize its already normalized scale be-
tween 0 and 1, allowing us to interpret it as the extent to which a city is ordered ac-
cording to a single grid. All remaining indicators’ formulae use the (unweighted)
simplified graph for the most faithful model of the urban form, geographically and
topologically. We calculate each city’s median street segment length ĩ, average node de-
gree k (i.e., how many edges are incident to the nodes on average), proportion of nodes
that are dead-ends P , and proportion of nodes that are four-way intersections P .
de 4w
Finally,wecalculateeachcitystreet network’saverage circuity, ς,as:
L
ς¼ net ð4Þ
L
gc
where L represents the sum of all edge lengths in the graph and L represents the
net gc
sum of all great-circle distances between all pairs of adjacent nodes. Thus, ς represents
how much more circuitous a city’s street network is than it would be if all its edges
were straight-linepaths betweennodes (Boeing 2019;Qureshietal. 2002).
We visualize these characteristics and examine their statistical relationships to
explore the nature of spatial order/disorder in the street networks’ orientations,
hypothesizing that more-gridded cities (i.e., higher φ values) have higher connect-
edness (i.e., higher node degrees, more four-way intersections, fewer dead-ends)
and less-winding street patterns. Finally, to systematically interpret city similar-
ities and differences, we cluster the study sites in a four-dimensional feature
space of the key indicators of interest (k, φ, ĩ, and ς), representing a cross-section
of street network character. We first standardize the features for appropriate scal-
ing, then perform hierarchical agglomerative clustering using the Ward linkage
method with a Euclidean metric.
Results
Table 1 presents the indicators’ values for each of the cities studied. We find that Η
o
and Η are very strongly correlated (Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient
w
r>0.99, p<0.001) and thus provide essentially redundant statistical information about
these networks. Therefore, the remainder of these findings focus on Η unless other-

wise explicitly stated. Three American cities (Chicago, Miami, and Minneapolis) have
the lowest orientation entropies of all the cities studied, indicating that their street net-
worksarethe mostordered. Infact, all16 cities with the lowest entropiesare intheUS
and Canada. Outside of the US/Canada, Mogadishu, Kyoto, and Melbourne have the
lowest orientation entropies. Surprisingly, the city with the highest entropy, Charlotte,

Chicago, the most ordered city, has a φ of 0.90, while Charlotte, the most disordered,
has a φ of 0.002. Recall that a φ of 0 indicates a uniform distribution of streets in every
direction and a φ of 1 indicates a single perfectly-ordered grid. Charlotte’s and São
Paulo’sstreetorientations arenearly perfectly disordered.
Venice, Mogadishu, Helsinki, Jerusalem, and Casablanca have the shortest median
street segment lengths (indicating fine-grained networks) while Kiev, Moscow,
Pyongyang, Beijing, and Shanghai have the longest (indicating coarse-grained net-
works). Due to their straight gridded streets, Buenos Aires, Detroit, and Chicago have
the least circuitous networks (only 1.1%–1.6% more circuitous than straight-line dis-
tances), while Caracas, Hong Kong, and Sarajevo have the most circuitous networks
(13.3%–14.8% more circuitous than straight-line distances) due largely to topography.
Helsinki and Bangkok have the lowest average node degrees, each with fewer than 2.4
streets per node. Buenos Aires and Manhattan have the greatest average node degrees,
both over 3.5 streets per node. Buenos Aires and Manhattan similarly have the largest
proportionsoffour-way intersectionsandthesmallest proportionsofdead-endnodes.
Figure 1 and Table 2 aggregate these results by world region (though note that the
regional aggregation sample sizes are relatively small and thus the usual caveats apply).
On average, the US/Canadian cities exhibit the lowest street orientation entropy, circu-
ity, and proportions of dead-ends as well as the highest median street segment lengths,
average node degrees, and proportions of four-way intersections. They are also by far
the most grid-like in terms of φ. On average, the European cities exhibit the highest
street orientation entropy and proportion of dead-ends as well as the lowest average
nodedegrees.Theyaretheleastgrid-likeintermsofφ.
To illustrate the geography of these order/entropy trends, Fig. 2 maps the 100 study
sites by φ terciles. As expected, most of the sites in the US and Canada fall in the high-
est tercile (i.e., they have low entropy and highly-ordered, grid-like street orientations),
but the notable exceptions of high-entropy Charlotte, Boston, and Pittsburgh fall in the
lowest tercile. Most of the sites in Europe fall in the lowest tercile (i.e., they have high

andSouth Asiafallinthemiddle tercile.
To better visualize spatial order and entropy, we plot polar histograms of each city’s
street orientations. Each polar histogram contains 36 bins, matching the description in
the methods section.Each histogram bar’s direction represents the compass bearings of
the streets (in that histogram bin) and its length represents the relative frequency of
streets with those bearings. The two examples in Fig. 3 demonstrate this. On the left,
Manhattan’s 29° angled grid originates from the New York Commissioners’ Plan of
1811, which laid out its iconic 800-ft×200-ft blocks (Ballon 2012; Koeppel 2015).
Broadway weaves diagonally across it, revealing the path dependence of the old Wick-
quasgeck Trail’s vestiges, by which Native Americans traversed the island long before
the first Dutch colonists arrived (Holloway 2013). On the right, Boston features a grid
in some neighborhoods like the Back Bay and South Boston, but they tend to not align
with one another, resulting in the polar histogram’s jumble of competing orientations.
Furthermore,thegridsarenotubiquitousandBoston’sotherstreetswindinvariousdi-
rections, resulting from its age (old by American standards), terrain (relatively hilly),
and historical annexation of various independent towns with their own pre-existing
streetnetworks.

presents them alphabetically to correspond with Table 1 while Fig. 5 presents them in
descendingorderofφvaluestobetterillustratetheconnectionbetweenentropy,gridded-
ness, and statistical dispersion. The plots exhibit perfect 180° rotational symmetry and,
typically, approximate 90° rotational symmetry as well. About half of these cities (49%)
have an at least approximate north-south-east-west orientation trend (i.e., 0°-90°-180°-
270° are their most common four street bearing bins). Another 14% have the adjacent

Straightforward orthogonal grids can be seen in the histograms of Chicago, Miami, and
others. Detroit presents an interesting case, as it primarily comprises two separate orthog-

Figures 4 and 5 put Chicago’s low entropy and Charlotte’s high entropy in per-
spective. Of these 100 cities, Chicago exhibits the closest approximation of a single
perfect grid with the majority of its streets falling into just four bins centered on
0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°. Its φ=0.90, suggesting it is 90% of the way between perfect
disorder and a single perfect grid, somewhat remarkable for such a large city. Most
American cities’ polar histograms similarly tend to cluster in at least a rough, ap-
proximate way. Charlotte, Rome, and São Paulo, meanwhile, have nearly uniform
distributions of street orientations around the compass. Rather than one or two
primary orthogonal grids organizing city circulation, their streets run more evenly
in every direction.
As discussed earlier, orientation entropy and weighted orientation entropy are strongly
correlated. Additionally, φ moderately and negatively correlates with average circuity (r(φ,
ς)=−0.432, p<0.001) and the proportion of dead-ends (r(φ, P )=−0.376, p<0.001), and

ies with more grid-like street orientations tend to also have more streets per node, more
four-way junctions, fewer winding street patterns, and fewer dead-ends. Besides these
relationships, φ also has a weak but significant correlation with median street segment
length (r(φ, ĩ)=0.27, p<0.01), concurring with previous findings examining the UK alone
(Gudmundsson and Mohajeri 2013). Average circuity moderately strongly and negatively
correlates with the average node degree (r(ς, k)=−0.672, p<0.001) and the proportion of
four-way intersections (r(ς, P )=−0.689, p<0.001). Cities with more winding street pat-

Figure 6 presents the dendrogram obtained from the cluster analysis, allowing
us to systematically explore cities that are more- or less-similar to each other.
The dendrogram’s structure suggests three high-level superclusters of cities, but
for further analysis, we cut its tree at an intermediate level (eight clusters) for
better external validity and more nuanced insight into those larger structures. To
visualize these clusters another way, we map their four-dimensional feature space
to two dimensions using t-SNE, a manifold learning approach for nonlinear
dimensionality reduction that is well-suited for embedding higher-dimensional

scatterplots the cities in these two dimensions: the t-SNE projection preserves
their cluster structure relatively well despite inherent information loss, but, given
the global density-equalizing nature of the algorithm, the relative distances within

and between clusters are not preserved in the embedding and should not be
interpreted otherwise.
Most of the North American cities lie near each other in three adjacent clusters
(red, orange, and blue), which contain grid-like—and almost exclusively North
American—cities. The orange cluster represents relatively dense, gridded cities like
Chicago, Portland, Vancouver, and Manhattan. The blue cluster contains less-
perfectly gridded US cities, typified by San Francisco and Washington (plus, interest-
ingly, Buenos Aires). The red cluster represents sprawling but relatively low-entropy
cities like Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Las Vegas. Sprawling, high-entropy Charlotte is
in a separate cluster (alongside Honolulu) dominated by cities that developed at least
in part under the auspices of twentieth century communism, including Moscow, Kiev,
Warsaw, Prague, Berlin, Kabul, Pyongyang, and Ulaanbaatar. Beijing and Shanghai are
alone in their own cluster, more dissimilar from the other study sites. The dark gray
cluster comprises the three cities with the most circuitous networks: Caracas, Hong
Kong, and Sarajevo. While the US cities tend to group together in the red, orange,
and blue clusters, the other world regions’ cities tend to distribute more evenly across
the green, purple, and light gray clusters.
Discussion
The urban design historian Spiro Kostof once said: “We ‘read’ form correctly only to
the extent that we are familiar with the precise cultural conditions that generated it…
The more we know about cultures, about the structure of society in various periods of
historyindifferentpartsoftheworld, the better weare abletoread theirbuilt environ-
ment” (Kostof 1991, p. 10). This study does not identify whether or how a city is
planned or not. Specific spatial logics cannot be conflated with planning itself, which
takes diverse forms and embodies innumerable patterns and complex structures, as do
informal settlements and organic urban fabrics. In many cities, centrally planned and
BoeingAppliedNetworkScience (2019) 4:67 Page16of19
self-organized spatial patterns coexist, as the urban form evolves over time or as a city
expands toaccrete newheterogeneous urban formsthroughsynoecism.
Yet these findings do, in concert, illustrate different urban spatial ordering principles
and help explain some nuances of griddedness. For example, gridded Buenos Aires has
a φ value suggesting it only follows a single grid to a 15% extent. However, its low cir-
cuity and high average node degree values demonstrate how it actually comprises mul-
tiple competing grids—which can indeed be seen in Figs. 4 and 5—and it clusters
accordingly in Figs. 6 and 7 with gridded American cities. Jointly considered, the φ in-
dicator, average circuity, average node degree, and median street segment length tell us
about the extent of griddedness and its character (curvilinear, straight-line, monolithic,
heterogeneous, coarse-grained, etc.). Charlotte further illustrates the importance of tak-
ing these indicators together. Although its φ and orientation entropy are more similar
to European cities’ than American cities’, it is of course an oversimplification to claim
that Charlotte is therefore the US city with the most “European” street network—in
fact, its median street segment length is about 50% longer than that of the average
European city, and among European cities, Charlotte clusters primarily with those of
the Communist Bloc. Pittsburgh, on the other hand, sits alone in a small sub-cluster
with Munich andVienna.
We find that cities with higher φ values also tend to have higher node degrees, more
four-way intersections, fewer dead-ends, and less-winding street patterns. That is, cities
that are more consistently organized according to a grid tend to exhibit greater con-
nectedness and less circuity. Interestingly, the Η and Η orientation entropies are ex-
o w
tremely similar and strongly correlated: the weighted curvatures (versus straight-line
orientation) of individual street segments have little impact on citywide orientation en-
tropy, but the average circuity of the city network as a whole positively correlates with
orientation entropy. Thisfinding deserves further exploration.
These results also demonstrate substantial regional differences around the
world. Across these study sites, US/Canadian cities have an average φ value
nearly thirteen-times greater than that of European cities, alongside nearly double
the average proportion of four-way intersections. Meanwhile, these European cit-
ies’ streets on average are 42% more circuitous than those of the US/Canadian
cities. These findings illustrate the differences between North American and
European urban patterns. However, likely due to such regional heterogeneity, this
study finds statistical relationships somewhat weaker (though still significant)
than prior findings examining cities in the UK exclusively.
Accordingly, given the heterogeneity of these world regions, future research can
estimate separate statistical models for individual regions or countries—or even the
neighborhoods of a single city to draw these findings closer to the scale of plan-
ning/design practice. The methods and indicators developed here offer planners
and designers a toolbox to quantify urban form patterns and compare their own
cities to those elsewhere in the world. Our preliminary results suggest trends and
patterns, but future work should introduce additional controls to clarify relation-
ships and make these findings more actionable for researchers and practitioners.
For instance, topography likely constrains griddedness and influences circuity and
orientation entropy: a study of urban elevation change and hilliness in conjunction
with entropy and circuity would help clarify these relationships. Additionally,

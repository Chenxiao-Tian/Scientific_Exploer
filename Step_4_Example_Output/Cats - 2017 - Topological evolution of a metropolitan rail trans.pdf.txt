construction of modes with higher speed, longer distances between stations, higher capacity and
higher costs per kilometre. The three development periods correspond to (a) short distances-short
travel times, dominated by trams in the inner-city and inner-suburbs, with both falling with the
dismantle of tram services; (b) long distances- longer travel times, metro extended to outer suburbs,
gradually attaining shorter travel times with almost unchanged distances due to improved
technology, and; (c) intermediate distances and speeds, multi-modal network, densification of the
network core and cross-radial connections contribute to improvements in accessibility in terms of
both distances and travel times. Hence, the longitudinal analysis performed in this study reveals that
the technological changes that took place during this time span have contributed to the evolution of
network topological structure, in conjunction with transformations in urban and transport planning.
The network science indicators used in this study allow for a systematic analysis and
comparison of the networks constructed for the entire study period based on the well-established
principles of complex system theory. Global topological indicators provide information on coverage,
connectivity, efficiency and directness. Local indicators are instrumental in analysing the spatial
distribution of accessibility (closeness centrality) and flows (betweenness centrality) which are often
used by transport planners and geographers in their analysis of transport networks. The
consequences of alternative planning strategies can be investigated using these indicators to examine
how it relates to past trends. While the analysis performed in this study goes beyond a strictly
topological analysis by including travel time, it is limited to the analysis of the infrastructure. Future
studies may analyse the evolution of the service layer superimposed on this network and passenger
flows. This will potentially allow gaining insights into how service types and congestion evolve in
transport networks.
While the exploration phase extends the network coverage and regional accessibility, the
densification phase increases network efficiency and contributes to network robustness. Overall,
network shape is developing towards the form seen by Roth et al (2012) for metro networks with a
dense core from which branches fork at secondary hubs. Increasing the number of circuits and moving
away from Stockholm’s MRTN dependency on few central and saturated hubs will contribute to
relieving congestion under normal conditions as well as strengthen network robustness in case of
disruptions by offering alternative routes. This yields a considerable strengthening of network
robustness compared to the findings of Wang et al. (2017) who compared 33 metro worldwide
networks and found Stockholm to be among the least robust networks with the lowest meshedness
coefficient and robustness indicator values (i.e. both being zero).
The findings of this study can support the development and increase the realism of models
designed to mimic transport network evolution. The topological analysis performed in this study can
be further enhanced by considering alternative graph representations that account for the service
layer (i.e. lines and frequencies) and its impacts on passenger travel times. Future studies of the
development patterns exhibited by other public transport networks will allow investigating whether
there are common drivers and rules that underlie network evolution and formation. In particular, this
will allow determining the extent to which path dependency and exploration-densification phases
dominate network development. Alternatively, various transport network planning strategies
undertaken by various actors can be specified and tested for example in an agent-based modelling
environment and the network structure results thereof be compared with those observed for real
transport networks. For example, different patterns might be observed for systems which have been
developed over a long period of time of about a century by a large number of actors in a traditionally
monocentric metropolitan area such as Moscow, London and Paris, as opposed to systems centrally
developed and rapidly expanded within a short time span of less than two decades such as in the case
of Guangzhou, Shanghai and Madrid.

transport services and road-bound services only seldom constitute part of the high-capacity public
transport. In the following, important milestones in the development of Stockholm MRTN, as well as
future developments, are described to set the analysis in the next section in context.
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Stockholm gradually grew beyond the old
town islands to encompass neighbouring islands. This process was facilitated by a steadily growth of
the tram network that connected city districts and nearby suburbs. In 1950, when the first metro line
was inaugurated, Stockholm had a large network of 21 tram line serving 212 stations, covering the area
now known as the inner-city. A set of detached train lines connected Stockholm and neighbouring
towns, and the metro system was gradually expanded to nearby suburbs. The 60’s marked an
important shift in Stockholm’s urban and transport planning. Similarly to many European cities, the
tram network was subject to a degradation in the post war decades and was gradually replaced by
buses and metro. In 1967, all the remaining inner-city tram lines were closed down as Sweden changed
from left-hand to right-hand traffic. The Miljonprogrammet, a national program for public housing
which was realized between 1965 and 1974, transformed Stockholm into a metropolitan area with the
metro system as its backbone. Cervero (1995) describes the importance of the metro in Stockholm’s
transition from being a monocentric city into being a multi-centred metropolis in the late 20th
century. The transition was aided by building an extensive rail network with different branches
connecting new satellite towns to Stockholm city centre. However, a recent spatial analysis based on
passenger flows suggests that a polycentric or even multi-centric urban structure has not yet emerged
in Stockholm (Cats et al. 2015).
The inseparable urban and transport planning in Stockholm is a prime example of a radial
public transport system which is primarily oriented towards regional accessibility rather than
providing local coverage. In addition, the commuter train services provide faster connection to the
outer-suburbs and in recent years also cities in nearby counties, facilitating the further integration of
the Mälaren lake region. However, the current regional planning guidelines promote a more
polycentric structure (Stockholm City 2011). Future developments of the MRTN which were
approved in 2013 are designed to support a stronger network of strategic nodes. The investment plan
includes the extension of the cross-radial light rail train (Cats and Jenelius 2015), several extensions
of the metro system and a cross-town tram line. In 2017 Stockholm City Line project will become
operational, increasing the capacity of the commuter and regional train system.
4.2 Implementation
Stockholm MRTN was analysed for each year between 1950 and 2025. The starting year marks the
opening of the metro system while the end year is set to mark the completion of the current mass
transit expansion plan. The network consists of tram, light rail train, metro, express high-speed
connections and local, commuter and regional trains. Only lines that operated with at least 23
departures per day per direction (which typically implies 3 departures per direction in the peak hour)
were included in the analysis for each of the years. Network data, including all operating stations and
lines, track lengths and service timetables were acquired from professional literature, technical
reports and databases, development programs, rail history books, museums and archives including the
Royal Library, Stockholm City Museum, Stockholm Transport Museum and Stockholm Railway
Association, among others (for more details see Appendix). Data collection involved compiling
network configurations including the exact location of stations, service lines, distances and scheduled
travel times between stations and service frequencies. Year on year changes in either network or
operations were carefully noted.
For each year, the list of MRTN lines that satisfy the frequency criterion, stations and
scheduled travel time between consecutive stations were recorded and mapped. Remarkably,
network topology has changed in 52 out of the 75 years considered. Undirected L-space graphs were
coded in Gephi, a free network visualization and analysis tool. Network indicators that involve the
calculation of link labels (i.e. diameter, betweenness and closeness centrality, directness) were
computed in MATLAB and then imported and visualized in Gephi. Coordinates of existing and future
stations were available from Stockholm County Traffic Administration (SLL), whereas coordinates of
stations that closed down were approximated based on their locations in the respective maps.

Abstract
The structure of transport networks is the outcome of a large number of infrastructure investment
decisions taken over a long time span. Network indicators are widely used for characterizing
transport network topology and its performance as well as provide insights on possible
developments. Little is known however on how rail bound public transport networks and their
network indicators have evolved into their current form. In this study I conduct a longitudinal
analysis of the topological evolution of a multimodal rail network by investigating the dynamics of its
topology for the case of Stockholm in 1950-2025. The starting year marks the opening of the metro
system while the end year is set to mark the completion of the current development plan. Based on a
compilation of network topology and service properties, a year-on-year analysis of changes in global
network efficiency and directness as well as local nodal centrality were conducted. Changes in
network topology exhibit smooth long-term technological and spatial trends as well as the signature
of top-down planning interventions. Stockholm rail network evolution is characterized by
contraction and stagnation periods followed by network extensions and is currently undergoing a
considerable densification, marking a shift from peripheral attachment to preferential attachment.
1. Introduction
Public transport networks constitute an important infrastructure in many metropolitan areas and are
often considered critical infrastructure (e.g. Homeland Security 2010). Public transport networks are
developed over a long time span alongside land-use developments. Mass rapid services in the form of
urban rail lines started with the introduction of steamed trams in the late 19 century and then rapidly
expanded with tram, metro, commuter train and light rail. Investments in urban rail networks are
expensive and complicated and are therefore considered strategic and long-term commitments with
urban rail lines functioning as a backbone. This study conducts a longitudinal analysis of the
topological evolution of a multimodal public transport network by investigating the dynamics of its
topology for the case of Stockholm in 1950-2025.
The form and structure of public transport networks has been a subject of considerable
research. In the last few years, an increasing number of studies have examined the properties of
networks worldwide using network science indicators. Lin and Ban (2013) provide a review of
applications of complex network theory in the transport domain. While these studies provide better
understanding of the characteristics of public transport networks, there is lack of knowledge on how
networks evolve until they arrive at their currently observed state. Knowledge on how public
transport networks and their respective indicators have evolved over time can be insightful when
considering infrastructure investments and identifying whether future development mark a
continuation or break away with respect to topological trends.
The urban rail network is clearly not a ‘self-organizing’ system as its planning, construction
and to a lesser extent its operations are subject to centralized decision making. Nevertheless, network
extension decisions are often the outcome of interactions between a large number of players that
pursue their interests rather than a unified planning process. A diverse set of stakeholders stemming
from multiple co-existing political levels and interests, successive planners and policies that their
influence changes over time, and, geographical coverage of multiple authorities, all of which have an
influence on how the network develops. Investments in new rail sections and stations where a travel
demand is expected results from a continuous and long process. The discontinuation of a service or
even the removal of tracks can also occur, albeit less common. Therefore, the term network evolution is
used in this study rather than network growth but the usage of this term does not imply a bottom-up
self-organizing governing principle.
The objective of this study is to quantitatively analyse the evolution of a public transport
network over a long period as well as its projected further development by examining changes in its
topology. Sun et al. (2015) argue that the lack of longitudinal data hinders understanding and
evaluating how network and urban mobility evolve. The lack of research on public transport network
evolution arguably stems from the difficulty to obtain data on historical network topologies. Data on
historical developments of urban public transport networks is not readily available and data
compilation for long time spans pose a significant challenge in performing such an analysis. Network
data, including distances and timetables, for each year from 1950 to 2025 was acquired for the purpose
of this study for the case study network of the metropolitan rail transport network of greater
Stockholm. The main contributions of this study are:
 Revealing the evolution of a multi-modal complex network designed by multiple actors over a
long time span (75 years)
 Investigating how network extent, density and directness using network science indicators
change over time
 Analysing the relation between changes in network structure, nodal centrality and travel
distance and travel time metrics
 Identifying patterns and transition points in network evolution and their relation to planning
policies, urban developments and operations
The results of the study provide for the first time to the best of the author knowledge empirical
evidence on the evolution of a metropolitan rail network developed over a long time.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: The following section reviews the
literature on public transport network topology and transport network evolution. Section 3 presents
the topological indicators used in analysing the networks. The case study of Stockholm is described in
Section 4, followed by the results and discussion in Section 5. Section 6 concludes with the
implications of the study findings and directions for further research.
2. Literature review
The structure of transport networks in general, and public transport networks in particular has long
been the subject of interest of researchers and planners. While networks could be classified in relation
to idealized prototypes such as grid and radial structures, only recently research advances enabled the
systematic quantification of network topological properties. This is largely driven by developments in
network sciences which provided researchers with a useful toolbox with solid theoretical foundations
in graph theory to examine transportation networks as reviewed by Lin and Ban (2013). This section
is devoted to reviewing the literature on public transport network topology (2.1) and the evolution of
transport networks (2.2).
2.1 Public transport topological analysis
Transport planners use a large variety of metrics to quantify networks in terms of the coverage,
accessibility and connectivity that they yield. These metrics are based on principles adopted from
graph theory and spatial analysis techniques (see Ducruet and Lugo 2013 for a review of these
methodologies). These approaches analyse the performance of a given transport network rather than
its underlying topological characteristics and often require detailed representation in Geographical
Information Systems software for transportation applications. Another line of research by transport
planners and geographers is concerned with creating a taxonomy of public transport network
prototypes and analysing their common network structure characteristics (e.g. Vuchic 2005). While
such studies provide insights on the diversity of network structures and discusses descriptively how
they grow over time, it does not quantify network characteristics and does not allow for a systematic
analysis of their evolution or comparison.
Complex network theory has increasingly emerged as a new scientific paradigm for analysing
and designing a wide range of systems including urban metabolisms, information and communication,
social relations, as well as transport systems. In the case of the latter, the networks are embedded in a
spatial-geographical system and the analysis is therefore typically concerned with a planar graph
representation. There is a growing literature which applies complex network theory methods to
analyse transport systems including road (Xie and Levinson 2009), rail (Wang et al. 2009), urban
public transport (von Ferber et al. 2009), air (Wang et al. 2011) and maritime (Ducruet 2017).
The analysis of network topology indicators suggests that different types of network share
common features. Two notable network classes are scale-free and small-world networks. A scale-free
network is characterized by a node degree distribution that follows a power law, implying that there
are many nodes with few connections and few nodes with many connections (Barabasi and Albert
1999). Previous studies assert that there are many man-made and complex natural networks that are
scale-free, including road and metro networks (Xie and Levinson 2007, Derrible and Kennedy 2011). A
blueprint of a small-world network, which is neither a random graph nor an orderly planned graph, is a
short path length and high clustering (Watts and Strogatz 1998). While a scale-free structure is
prominent for public transport networks when represented in L-space (i.e. nodes correspond to
stations and links correspond to a service connecting consecutive stations), small-world has not been
often observed when using the P-space representation (i.e. nodes correspond to stations and links
correspond to the existence of at least one common line) (von Ferber et al. 2009, Sienkiewicz and
Holyst 2005, Lee et al. 2008).
Several studies analysed and compared the network topology of metro and urban rail systems
across the world. von Ferber et al (2009) describe different ways to represent a public transport
network. Comparisons of indicators for networks worldwide were performed by Derrible and
Kennedy (2010) and Zhang et al. (2013) for 32 metro and 30 urban-rail networks, respectively. The
former proposed metrics for classifying networks based on their state, form and structure.
In the context of public transport, topological indicators have been most extensively used for
analysing network vulnerability in case of link or node failure and for the identification of critical
links. This research topic was investigated for 17 prototype network structures (Zhang et al. 2015),
the world largest metro systems (Angeloudis and Fisk 2006), 32 metro systems worldwide (Derrible
and Kennedy 2010), London and Paris (von Ferber et al. 2012), Nanjing (Deng et al. 2013) and Madrid
(Rodriguez-Nunez and Garcia-Palomares 2014). The results demonstrate that public transport
networks vary in their capacity to absorb random and targeted attacks. The availability of cyclic paths
which allow to perform detours and bypass a disrupted area in case needed contributes to network
robustness. Cats (2016) enriched the topological analysis with travel demand distribution to evaluate
the impacts of network extension plans on its robustness.
While network science is increasingly applied to the transport, and in particular public
transport domain, many of these applications are performed without considering key network
features. Dupuy (2013) asserts that by neglecting such features and the urban planning context,
studies performed by scientists from other disciplines in the field of network geometry and urban
railway systems provide very limited recommendations to network planners and thus obstruct
potential implementations. Remarkably, only few studies have included information on travel
impedance (e.g. distance or time), representing the public transport network as an unweighted graph.
The analysis of topological indicators for non-weighted graphs is then based on counting links,
questioning the value of often reported indicators such as network diameter (longest shortest path),
average shortest path, node closeness and betweenness centrality. Assigning link labels is essential for
measuring the intended network coverage, node efficiency, location accessibility and interchanging
flows, respectively.
2.2 Transport network evolution
The process in which networks evolve over time is an important aspect in the growing interest in
network science. Nevertheless, most studies have focused on the topological analysis of networks in
their current state. As stressed by Dupuy (2013), graph theory-based studies resulted with a static
representation of the network, hindering the analysis of network development process. In their
review of how network science has been integrated into the work of spatial scientists, Ducruet and
Beauguitte (2014) concluded that research concerning the evolution and dynamics of networks using
network science concepts and methods has remained surprisingly unexplored as most studies
adopting a static approach. In line with Dupuy’s arguments, some the of studies that have taken a
dynamic perspective to network topology were performed by scientists from disciplines other than
transport, in particular from physics and computer sciences, as reflected by the neglect of spatial
elements in the analysis and interpretation.
In the absence of empirical data, several studies have simulated how transport networks may
have evolved by specifying principles that may govern their development. Ash and Newth (2007)
modelled the evolution of a simple grid network with links being added or removed in an iterative
manner with network robustness measured in terms of average efficiency as the objective function.
Xie and Levinson (2008) proposed an agent-based approach for simulating how road networks may
develop if in each iteration roads that are not used as much were to be abandoned whereas heavily
used roads would have been upgraded. Model results show that some networks had similar
characteristics even though they have developed from very different initial types of networks. This
was taken as an indication that transport networks possess robust properties that can emerge from
the interplay between many different actors. While this approach may be useful for analysing the
outcomes of alternative strategies, it lacks empirical underpinning and assumes a highly systematic
and consistent network design approach.
Longitudinal infrastructure data is increasingly made available for road and heavy rail
networks. This has led to a stream of empirical research in recent years into the development of these
networks. The findings of these studies suggest that developments range from self-organizing
patterns to a top-down planning signature, with most networks exhibiting a combination of the two.
Both Strano et al. (2012) and Mohajeri and Gudmundsson (2014) identified two underlying
mechanisms governing street network growth: expansion and densification. Strano et al. suggest that
these are two development phases: an exploration phase where branches are built into areas
previously not served by roads followed by a densification phase where the network became denser
through the addition of links between already existing branches. Interestingly, the most important
roads as measured by node betweenness centrality maintained their importance throughout the 200
years analysis period. Conversely, Barthélemy et al. (2013) in their analysis of how the street network
of Paris evolved over more than 200 years observed a self-organized smooth growth and densification
was penetrated by large-scale top-down planning. A similar pattern was found by Thevenin et al.
(2016) in their analysis of the evolution of the French railway network over a century and also
resonates with the findings of Erath et al. (2009) concerning the development of the Swiss road
network between 1950-2005 where a period of systematic growth is followed by a stagnation. Top-
down planning was found particularly important in the investigation of the changes in accessibility
offered by the Chinese railway network by Wang et al. (2009) during the 20th century. They stress
the strong political influence and the importance of central governmental policies in network
development and its impacts on changes in accessibility and the generation of economic centres.
Research into the evolution of airline and shipping networks is facilitated by the recent
availability of open data concerning their line operations. These highly dynamic networks are
characterized by point-to-point line-based networks that develop at a continental or global scale and
operate in a highly competitive setting. Airline traffic is highly market-driven and exercises strong
fluctuations in response to changes in demand patterns as shown by Lin and Ban (2014) and Wang et
al. (2014) for the air transport networks of the US in 1990-2010 and China in 1930-2012, respectively.
Ducruet (2017) concludes from analyzing the dynamics of multi-layer maritime global flows that their
evolution is highly path-dependent with the reinformcement of major hubs. The reinforcement of
existing hubs - a growth pattern that tends to connect new nodes to nodes that already well-
connected (also known as ‘the rich getting richer’ phenomenon) - will give rise to a scale-free
network.
Few studies have discussed the development of metropolitan public transport systems using a
network science approach. Based on a static analysis of three bus networks in China, Yang et al.
(2014) concluded from the node degree distribution that network topology evolved through random
network extensions, although the evolution of these network has not been directly investigated.
Metro networks were found to share some common topological properties even when considering
networks that have been constructed at different times and by different governmental structures.
Derrible (2012) examined trends in how betweenness centrality changes in metro networks as a
function of their size in terms of number of nodes (stations). He observed an exponentially increasing
trend with larger networks having a much more distributed betweenness centrality suggesting a
process of democratization where central nodes in larger networks obtain a smaller share of the total
betweenness centrality compared to those in smaller network. This analysis did not however take
travel times into account. The only study that to the best of the author’s knowledge investigated the
evolution of public transport network structure was conducted by Roth et al (2012) who investigated
how fourteen metro networks around the world have developed over time. They observed that metro
networks develop into a shape with a denser core surrounded by a circular line and branches
extending from the core to suburbs, often through fork stations. The analysis by Roth et al.
considered the unweighted graph, though discarding network distances or travel times and were
therefore restricted to configurational metrics. An analysis limited to nodal accessibility was
performed by Chen et al. (2014) who examined the rapid development of Guangzhou metro network
in 1999-2011.
Complex network theory applications to public transport have resulted with a growing
knowledge of the topological properties of public transport networks. Several studies have also
modelled how public transport network may evolve over time based on certain growth principles.
However, there is lack of knowledge on how public transport networks evolve in a context where
investments in surface transport infrastructure span over long periods of time. This arguably stems
from the difficulty of obtaining and compiling longitudinal data, partially attributed to corresponding
organisational and technological changes. This study aims to extend the knowledge on how public
transport topology evolves over time by empirically investigating the dynamics of the indicators
presented in the following section.
3. Network topology indicators
L-space is used for representing the public transport network in this study. This graph representation
is adopted in this study because it allows focusing on the availability of physical tracks which
represent a long-term investment in infrastructure. Hence, the physical network infrastructure is
defined by a directed graph G(S,E), where the node set S represents rail stations, and the link
(edge) set E SS represents rail segments connecting a pair of stations. The graph could be
described as a 𝑆×𝑆 adjacency matrix, 𝐴, where each entry 𝐴 equals 1 if 𝑖 and 𝑗 are connected with a
𝑖𝑗
link and equals 0 if there is no direct connection. Each link eE is a service-segment that may be
operated by one or several public transport lines and induces a certain travel impedance. Link labels
may correspond to link length, in-vehicle travel time or a generalized travel cost function for the
respective link. Let 𝑙 and 𝑡 denote respectively the length (distance) and travel time associated
𝑒𝑖𝑗 𝑒𝑖𝑗
with link 𝑒 which connects stations 𝑖 and 𝑗 (𝑖,𝑗 ∈𝑆).
𝑖𝑗
In the following, the network indicators used for investigating network states and evolution
are defined. Global network indicators are used to characterise network structure whereas local
network indicators quantify the centrality of network elements. For a comprehensive review of
spatial network indicators, the reader is referred to Barthélemy (2010).
3.1 Global network structure indicators
The number of stations and links is denoted by the cardinality of the node and link sets, |𝑆| and |𝐸|,
respectively. The total network length of all rail segments is
𝑙 = ∑ 𝑙 (1)
𝑒∈𝐸 𝑒
In addition, network size can be assessed by measuring its diameter:
𝑑 =max 𝑑 (2)
𝑖,𝑗∈𝑆 𝑖𝑗
Where 𝑑 is the distance shortest path between nodes 𝑖 and 𝑗. The diameter measures the extent of
𝑖,𝑗
the graph in terms of the maximum topological length (i.e. rail segment-km) between any pair of
nodes (i.e. stations). The shortest path in terms of the number of sections (all link labels equal one),
network distance or travel time can be found for each pair of nodes using for example the Dijkstra
algorithm.
Several network indicators can be used to describe network density and connectivity. A
simple and commonly-used measure of network connectivity, the gamma index, is defined as the ratio
between the number of links and the maximum number of links in a complete planar graph:
|𝐸|
𝛾 = (3)
3(|𝑆|−2)
The gamma index equals 1 in the case of a complete graph. In the context of rail networks it can be
interpreted as the likelihood that a pair of stations has a direct rail segment connecting them. A more
connected network offers a greater number of alternative routes between any pairs of stations.
Similarly, the alpha index is an indicator of network meshedness and ranges between 0 for a tree and 1 for
a complete graph. It is defined as the ratio between the number of elementary cyclic and the
maximum number of cycles in a graph:
|𝐸|−|𝑆|+1
𝛼 = (4)
2|𝑆|−5
The alpha corresponds to the probability that it is possible to travel from any station back to the same
station without traversing the same (bi-directional) rail segment twice. This is an indicator of
network robustness as it provides information on network redundancy in case of a link closure.
As a planar spatial network, an important feature of a public transport network is its
directness. The directness of each connection is defined as the average discrepancy ratio between
network distance (measured in rail segment-km) and the geographical distance, or in other words the
percentage-wise detour that the network structure induces. Overall network directness is measured as
the average ratio calculated over all origin-destination (station) pairs
𝑞 =
∑ 𝑖∈𝑆∑ 𝑖≠𝑗∈𝑆𝑙𝑖𝑗
(5)
|𝑆|(|𝑆|−1)∑ 𝑖∈𝑆∑ 𝑖≠𝑗∈𝑆𝑙̂
𝑖𝑗
Where 𝑙̂ is the geodesic distance between nodes 𝑖 and 𝑗. The higher node directness is, the greater
𝑖𝑗
the travel impedance compared with the hypothetical shortest path.
3.2 Local centrality indicators
In addition to measures that are computed at the network level, indicators defined at the node level
allow investigating the spatial variation of topological properties among stations. Moreover, local
indicators can facilitate the investigation of global network characteristics by comparing statistics of
their distributions across networks.
Three measures of stations centrality are considered in this study to capture the extent of
direct connections to other stations, accessibility to all other stations and its role in connecting pairs
of stations across the network. The simplest node centrality indicator is node degree which is simply
the number of stations directly connected to each station
𝑘 = ∑ 𝐴 ∀𝑖 ∈𝑆 (6)
𝑖 𝑗∈𝑆 𝑖𝑗
The node degree corresponds thus to the number of incoming/outgoing rail segments per station.
While node degree measures the number of direct neighbours, it does not provide information
on how close or far the station is from all other stations in the network. Node closeness centrality is
defined based on the shortest paths from a certain node to all other nodes in the network
1
𝑐 = ∑ ∀𝑖 ∈ 𝑆 (7)
𝑖 𝑖≠𝑗∈𝑆
𝑑𝑖,𝑗
This definition implies that station closeness centrality increases for lower travel impedances to other
stations in the network and hence reflects the accessibility of each station from all other stations. The
average node closeness is commonly used to quantify network efficiency since it reflects the average
number of stations that are passed when travelling between any pair of stations.
The importance of a station could also be considered in terms of its role in connecting other
stations. For example, a peripheral station that is poorly connected locally (i.e. low node degree and
closeness) may constitute a bridge between two sub-networks. The latter is especially important in
the context of multi-modal metropolitan rail networks where a station may serve as a terminal hub
connecting services with distinguished operations and hierarchy (e.g. commuter train and trams).
This is measured by node betweenness centrality which is defined as the share of shortest paths that
traverse through a certain station
𝑏 = ∑
𝑛𝑗,𝑘(𝑖)
∀𝑖 ∈ 𝑆 (8)
𝑖 𝑗≠𝑘∈𝑆
𝑛𝑗,𝑘
Where 𝑛 (𝑖) is the number of shortest paths between stations 𝑗 and 𝑘 that traverse through station 𝑖
𝑗,𝑘
and 𝑛 is the total number of shortest paths found between these pair of stations. This definition of
𝑗,𝑘
node betweenness centrality is inherently dependent on the number of nodes. To facilitate the
analysis of changes in station relative importance, a standardized indicator is defined by dividing Eq. 8
by the sum of node centrality for all stations:
𝑏̃ = 𝑏𝑖 ∀𝑖 ∈ 𝑆 (9)
𝑖 ∑ 𝑖∈𝑆𝑏𝑖
The standardized betweenness centrality corresponds thus to the percentage of network shortest
paths that traverse through a certain station. The standardized centrality indicator allow comparing
the betweenness centrality distribution for different networks.
4. The Case of Stockholm metropolitan rail network
4.1 Study area
The evolution of the metropolitan rail transport network (MRTN) was investigated for the case of
Stockholm, Sweden. Only rail-bound services were considered in this analysis because they require
substantial long-term investments and therefore become an integral part of the metropolitan
infrastructure over long periods of network lifetime. Furthermore, our interest lies in mass public
Based on the analysis of network indicators, phases in the development of the case study network are
identified (Section 5.1). Network structure and its evolution in terms of its global coverage,
connectivity, efficiency and directness are then analysed (5.2). Trends in local centrality indicators
and their underlying causes are then discussed (5.3). Finally, the co-evolution of several key indicators
is investigated (5.4).
5.1 Three periods in the evolution of the network
Based on the evolution of three indicators of Stockholm MRTN size (Figure 1), three distinctive
periods with pronounced transition points can be identified:
(a) Contraction, 1950-1967: The number of stations and links contracted gradually between 1950-1966
where each year saw on average the closure of one tram line and then fell dramatically in 1967
when the remaining tram lines were dismantled. The latter happened in conjunction with the
shift into right-side driving which marked the end of the compact street-level rail network in the
inner-city. Notwithstanding, the simultaneous construction of metro lines counteracted these
closures resulting with a slight increase in total network length.
(b) Stagnation, 1968-1998: Three decades of relative stagnation with incremental extensions of
existing lines. This period starts after the completion of the large-scale urban and transport
development of suburbs built around stations along radial metro corridors. Already in 1978 the
metro lines have almost reached their current form, extending well-beyond the inner-city. Total
network length increased by less than 2.5% between 1978-1998.
(c) Growth, 1999-2025: A period of substantial and consistent growth. This period is characterized by
a shift in urban and transport policy with a focus on: (1) regional integration, and (2) increased
capacity and connections in the core of the network. While these two trends may seem
contradictory at first, the analysis below demonstrates that they are pursued simultaneously. The
development of long commuter and regional services culminated in 1999-2003 resulting in an
rapid increase in network length. The opening of new light rail line in the 2000’s and future
metro extension plans lead to a growing number of stations and rail links in the core of the
network contributing to a modest increase in network length.
It is thus evident that Stockholm MRTN manifests a complex non-monotonous growth
pattern, demonstrating some abrupt changes as well as periods of incremental growth. The average
number of new links per year increased steadily from 1.22 in the period 1967-1985 to 1.53 in 1986-1998,
2.2 in 1999-2009 and set to increase to 2.6 in the period of 2010-2025. Moreover, while the number of
nodes and links follows an overall similar trend of contraction, stagnation and growth, the total
network length follows a generally increasing trend with long periods of incremental increases and a
short period of a rapid growth. Remarkably, the number of nodes and links in 2025 will still fall short
by 12% and 8% of the respective values in 1950, while network length and the population of
Stockholm metropolitan area increase to 213% and 267%, respectively, of their 1950 values. This
reflects the shift from a dense inner-city tram network to a metropolitan mass transit system with
larger station spacing. It is thus important to analyse the trends in the context of the underlying
transition from low-capacity rail services characterized by short distances between stations and
lower speeds (i.e. city trams operating in mixed traffic) to high-capacity rail-bound services that
operate with longer distances between stations with higher speeds (i.e. underground and commuter
trains).

5.2 Network structure
Table 1 provides a summary of network indicators for six selected years that mark important
milestones in Stockholm MRTN development. Alongside the population in the case study area and in
addition to the number of nodes, links and network length, columns 6-10 present the network-level
indicators: diameter, average path length, connectivity, meshedness, and directness.
Stockholm MRTN growth stems from a combination of increased network coverage, i.e.
extending its reach, and increased network density, by connecting already existing stations. Growing
geographical coverage was the main driver of network growth until the 2000’s. Even though the
diameter is determined by the extreme value of the path length distribution, its development is in line
with that of other indicators of network size until 2010. The diameter of the Stockholm MRTN
decreased slightly between 1950 and 1967 as the tramways that extended to nearby suburbs were
closed down while the metro had covered a smaller area until the 1990’s. Since the mid-1990’s,
network diameter was determined by commuter and regional trains which increased the reach of the
MRTN from approximately 100km to 150km, extending beyond the boundaries of Stockholm county
into neighbouring counties to the north, north west and south west of Stockholm. However, the
diameter slightly decreased in 2025 due to the closure of one of the regional train terminals and with
investments focused on central parts of the network.
Network growth in 2010-2025 stems from a rapid construction of new links (Figure 1) that
densify the network rather than extend it. The densification of the core is driven by a combination of
planning policies: (1) intensifying sub-centres and strengthening their inter-connections (Cats et al.
2015); (2) increasing the capacity and relieving congestion of main axes by adding parallel corridors
and bypass alternatives (Cats et al. 2016, Jenelius and Cats 2015); (3) improving network robustness
by adding redundancy and thus rerouting possibilities (Cats 2016). The average path length which
had consistently increased until 2010, decreases as a result of the current expansion plan. In other
words, network efficiency improves as new travel alternatives offer shorter connections. The sharp
increase in average path length in 1967 stems from the closure of many tram stations which exercised
shorter stop spacing compared with other rail-bound modes. This reflects thus a change in the
composition of the multi-modal mix of Stockholm MRTN, shifting towards longer spacing modes
such as metro and commuter train.
Network connectivity has followed a U-shaped development in the period between 1950-
2025 as indicated by both gamma (Eq. 3) and alpha (Eq. 4) indicators. The compact dense network of
the 1950s fragmented to the minimum values of 0.339 and 0.0054 in 1967 for the gamma and alpha
indicators, respectively, indicating that the network included about one third of all possible links and
half a percent of all possible cycles. Network connectivity and meshedness increased gradually
between the years 1968-2000 and then increased substantially in the following decade and finally
reached the 1950 level in 2010. An accelerated growth in network connectivity is projected in the
years leading to 2025, reflecting a densification of the network and the construction of cross-radial
(suburb to suburb) connections. In 2025 Stockholm MRTN will offer the same connectivity as in 1950
but for a much greater service area. Network meshedness will be in 2025 more than twice as high as in
2010 and ten times higher than in 1967, suggesting a significant improvement in network robustness
thanks to increased redundancy in case of disruptions (Jenelius and Cats 2015).

The average network directness (Eq. 5) follows an inverted U-shape development with the
detour rate yielding the maximal value in 1967 with the average path length being 42.6% longer than
the geodesic distance (Table 1). This large path discrepancy is attributed to the dominance of local
train services in Stockholm archipelago landscape in 1967 and their reliance on few bridges that often
require detours. Directness improved gradually between 1967-1999 and then more rapidly in 2000-
2025, yielding after 75 years approximately the same level of directness that was offered in 1950. This
pattern is evident in Figure 2 where the cumulative density functions of the directness indicators for
each year from 1950 to 2025 is plotted. The median path detour ratio increased from 1.35 in 1950 to
1.47 in 1968, decreased gradually due to relatively direct commuter and regional train services and will
get back to 1.35 by 2025 thanks to the availability of cross-radial connections that enable travellers to
bypass the city centre which was almost inevitable in the radial MRTN structure.

5.3 Evolution in node centrality measures
The investigation of station centrality measures enables the analysis of station importance and role in
the greater network for a given year and how they evolve over the study period. Changes in the
statistical properties of the distributions of node centrality indicators are first discussed followed by a
discussion of the patterns of their spatial distribution.
The three periods identified in Section 5.1 are also visible in the evolution of node degree.
Figure 3 depicts the average and coefficient of variation (CV) of the node degree for 1950-2025. The
average value decreases from about 2.1 direct neighbours for each node to almost 2.01 and then
increased gradually to 2.05 in 2000 to then rapidly bounce back to an average value of 2.2 in 2025. The
vast majority of the nodes having a degree of two (consecutive stations along the same line) and few
nodes having many connections (transfer hubs) or only one (terminals). This pattern emerges from a
preferential attachment scheme with only 1% of the stations having a degree of six or higher. This
finding is in line with previous studies that examined L-space of public transport networks (Lin and
Ban 2013). As reflected in the increase of CV from 0.3 to 0.45, the node degree distribution becomes
more skewed due to the increase in number and diversity of transfer hubs, with second- and third-tier
interchanges emerging in the boundaries of Stockholm inner-city (2000’s) and nearby suburbs
(2010’s). The pronounced radial network dominated by the metro network with a single station that
allows transferring between all metro and commuter train lines has evolved into a meshed centre with
a ring of hubs beyond which rail lines fork (see Figure 5).

Figure 3: Average and coefficient of variation of node degree per year
The evolution of average node closeness centrality in terms of distance and travel time
manifests a distinctively different pattern than node degree. The signature of the three development
period is evident in Figure 4 where average closeness centrality is shown for both distance and travel
time. While global closeness is often considered an indicator of network transmission efficiency, this
analysis highlights the sensitivity of the results to the selected impedance factor. Both closeness
centrality indicators yielded the maximum value in the mid-1950s and then fell drastically in 1967. The
compact and dense tram network resulted with closely connected nodes in terms of both distance and
travel time and its degradation meant longer paths between the remaining stations. The expansion of
the metro led to a further decrease (1968-1978) in average distance closeness because new stations
were situated further away from the network core, increasing the average path distance. In contrast,
travel time closeness increased because the metro offers significantly higher speeds and new travel
alternatives leading to a reduction in the average path travel time. This transport planning policy
catered for improving regional accessibility in conjunction with the construction of satellite towns.
The distance closeness further decreased in the 2000’s due to the integration of regional
services into the MRTN and then bounces back from 2010 onwards due to the densification of the
network core with new centrally positioned stations and cross-radial connections that cut down
travel distances as well as travel times, improving accessibility in the case study area. This trend will
result with a travel time closeness centrality in 2025 (0.032) that is approaching the average value in
1950 (0.034). This is remarkable as the distance covered by the network is much greater (see network
diameter and a 43% decrease in distance closeness centrality - reflecting that the average distance
between a pair of nodes has almost doubled) but the greater travel speeds provided by primarily
metro and commuter trains will achieve a similar travel time closeness to the one that existed in the
much smaller urban area of 1950 which was served by trams. This demonstrates the improved
accessibility and enlarged labour market enabled by the development of the MRTN.

Figure 4: Average node closeness centrality measured in terms of travel time and distance per year
The spatial variation of accessibility, as measured in terms of travel time node closeness
centrality, is illustrated for the selected years in Figure 5. There are pronounced and persistent
differences between network core and branches. In line with the findings based on the analysis of
passenger flows in Stockholm by Cats et al. (2015), the MRTN reflects as well as facilitates a growing
and denser network core connecting centres of activities. The on-going networks extensions will
result with a significant improvement in accessibility, especially in the southern part of the network
core and north-west of the network core, which was also found to contribute to the capability of the
case study network to withstand link breakdowns (Cats 2016). These developments constitute
strategic and costly investments as they entail constructing tunnels and bridges to connect islands
and land on different shores of the sea and lake as well as constructing over- and underground tracks
in densely built-up areas.

centrality is highlighted)
The Stockholm MRTN is becoming increasingly dependent on few stations. Figure 6 presents
the distribution of the standardized betweenness node centrality (Eq. 9) for 1950-2025 in its
cumulative form. It shows the distribution of relative station importance in connecting origin-
destination pairs across the network when searching for the paths that yield the shortest travel time.
While the overall shape of the distribution remains stable over the analysis period, the distribution
becomes in the first several decades more egalitarian and thereafter reverses into a more oligarchic
form, even if having few more oligarchs. This implies that passenger flow distribution can be expected
to be extremely uneven. This finding is in disagreement with Derrible (2012) who concluded from the
topological analysis of 28 worldwide metro networks that betweenness centrality is more evenly
distributed for larger networks while neglecting travel times (i.e shortest path was calculated in
terms of number of intermediate hubs) in his analysis. For example, the share of nodes that are
situated on the shortest paths connecting more than 1% of all origin-destination pairs each in the case
study network increased from 7.5% in 1950 to 21% in 1971 and then decreases to 11% in 2025. These
shifts suggest that the network was heavily dependent on a small number of nodes in the 1950s for
transmitting travel flows, followed by a more distributed structure that was then gradually almost
reversed back to earlier centralization levels, albeit for a larger network. Due to the relation between
betweenness centrality and flow distribution, this can have ramifications for hub saturation levels and
passenger and pedestrian congestion.

The most central stations as measured by node centrality indicators change considerably
during the analysis period. The most central stations as measured in terms of their node degree change
considerably over the years because of the local nature of this indicator which can change more
rapidly in response to limited interventions. For example, only one of the top five stations in 1950, (i.e.
Centralstationen) retains its position in the top five in 2025. In contrast, betweenness and closeness
centrality see dramatic changes between 1950 and 1967 due to the overhaul change in network
topology while more incremental changes have taken place ever since.
There is a consensus among the three centrality indicators that Centralstationen is the most
central station as it name implies from 1967 onwards. This is however far from universal as the
centrality of many stations varies considerably depending on the centrality indicator considered. For
example, some of the most central stations when measured in terms of its travel time-wise closeness
are neither transfer hubs nor heavily traversed station for connecting origin-destination pairs (i.e.
Kungsträdgården). In contrast, stations that serve as gateway transfer hubs between network trunks
and branches (e.g. Östra Station, Älvsjö) are characterized by high betweenness centrality due to their
bridging function even if they are not central in terms of closeness travel time.
Until the late 1970’s, all central stations are in the core of the inner-city.. The construction of the
metro system resulted with new hubs in the edges of the inner-city. The urban and transport
development since the 1990’s aimed at expending the boundaries of the inner-city and provide greater
accessibility to such strategic nodes.
5.4 Relations between network indicators
The evolution of Stockholm MRTN was assessed in the previous sections by studying the evolution of
various network indicators. The inter-relation between selected network indicators was examined by
investigating their co-evolution to provide further insights into the underlying changes in network
structure. Figure 7 presents a scatter plot of the number of nodes and the gamma index (Eq. 3) of
network connectivity for the 52 unique network topologies in 1950-2025. The three development
periods described in Section 5.1 are again clearly visible: (a) with the removal of nodes, connectivity
decreases linearly (1950-1966) and then falls abruptly to the lowest number of stations in 1967; (b) the
addition of nodes gradually improves connectivity (1967-1999), and; (c) this trend accelerates in the
last period (2000-2025) as the number of connections increases faster than the number of stations.
The latter signifies an investment policy focused on increased connectivity rather than coverage.

Figure 7: Relation between number of nodes and connectivity 1950-2025
When investigating the relation between the number of nodes and the average node degree, a
very similar trend to the one observed in Figure 7 is revealed. While Zhang et al. (2013) found only a
slight increasing trend in average node degree for networks with a higher number of nodes, there is a
clear positive linear relation between these two network indicators in the case of Stockholm (𝑅2 =
0.56 and 𝑅2 = 0.95 when calculated only for 2000-2025). This is expected since the development of
the Stockholm network was first directed towards low-density coverage followed by increased
connectivity leading to an increase in node degree at more mature network stages.
The co-evolution of average node closeness centrality in terms of distance and travel time is
presented in Figure 8. As can be expected, there is a strong positive correlation between the average
values of the two closeness indicators, albeit only 68% of the variation in closeness centrality in terms
of travel time is explained by closeness centrality in terms of distance. A perfect correlation would
have been yielded if travel times were to remain the same across the networks throughout the analysis
period. This is evidently not the case given the aforementioned shift towards relying on faster rail
services.

6. Conclusions
The case of Stockholm demonstrates that network evolution patterns carry the signature of planning
policies, metropolitan developments and changes in system operations. The results of the analysis of
the development of network structure along with a discussion of the underlying policies and
technological changes are relevant for both transport planners and network scientists. The analysis
reveals that network evolution can be characterised by abrupt changes as well as incremental growth
and by investments as well as disinvestments. Network development does not follow thus in reality a
simple growth pattern but is rather subject to multiple simultaneous trends that manifest themselves
over a long period of time due to the lag between planning policies, investment decisions,
construction of large-scale infrastructure projects and launching new passenger services.
Notwithstanding, network evolution is clearly path-dependent and even though changes in planning
policies can result in a change in course (e.g. dismantling the tramways or shifting towards
densification and polycentric planning), network states and the range of possible futures highly
depends, although not fully determined, by previous stages.
The evolution of the Stockholm rail network is characterized by three distinctive
development phases of contraction, stagnation and growth. Network developments exhibit first a
period of exploration (1967-2000) followed by a period of densification (2000-2025). This represents
a shift from peripheral attachment – adding stations at the edges of existing lines, extending branches
- to preferential attachment – new stations are connected to nodes which are already well-connected.
The current development trends can be expected to continue in the foreseen future also beyond 2025
based on Stockholm’s unusually long-term vision plan for the development of its public transport
network up to 2070 (Stockholm2070, 2017). If this trend will indeed persist in the future, then the
network may become scale-free (Barabasi and Albert 1999), resembling the evolutionary process
identified by Strano et al (2012) for a region-wide street network which went through a similar
transition from exploration to densification.
Technological changes that result with increased commercial speed play an important role
alongside the construction of previously non-existing links. It is remarkable that in 2025 the
Stockholm network will offer the same level of directness, connectivity and accessibility that were
offered in 1950 for a much smaller area. This is driven by the dramatic shift in the modal composition
of Stockholm rail-bound network during the analysis period. This shift is characterized by the

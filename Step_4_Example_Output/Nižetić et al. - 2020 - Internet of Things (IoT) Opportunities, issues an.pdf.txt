The food waste issue is one of the major problems (Keng et al.,
2020), since it has become a global problem, especially in devel-
oped economies. It is estimated that more than 28% of available
agriculture areas is ‘‘reserved’’ for food waste and unfortunately
more than 800$106 people are currently hungry, (Fao.org, 2020).

The application of IoT technologies in the agricultural sector

Currently, various technological solutions are being developed to

Some of them are already available on the market for wide
implementation, (Iot.farsite, 2020). The developed solutions are
mostlydirectedtowardsthesmartmonitoringofwastebins(Dhana

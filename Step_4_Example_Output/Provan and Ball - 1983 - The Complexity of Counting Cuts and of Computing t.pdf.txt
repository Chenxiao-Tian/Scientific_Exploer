1. Introduction. The inherent intractability of certain counting and reliability
problems has been studied by Ball [1], Rosenthal [11], and Valiant [12]. Valiant
defines the notion of the #P-complete class of counting problems, and shows that
problems in this class are at least as hard as NP-complete problems. He then goes on
to show that several important counting and reliability problems are #P-complete,
amongthem, countingperfectmatchingsinbipartitegraphsandevaluatingtheproba-
bility that two given nodes in a probabilistic graph are connected. Three important
problems are mentioned by Ball and Valiant, for which the complexity is not known,
namely:
(1) evaluatingthe probability that aprobabilisticgraph is connected,
(2) approximatingthe probability that aprobabilistic graphis connected,
(3) approximating the probability that two vertices of a probabilistic graph are
connected.
In view of results by the authors in [2], the probability measure associated with
problems (1) and (2) seems to have considerably more structure than that associated
with (3). In [3] they also show the power of the structure in providing good upper
and lower bounds for this measure. We show in this paper, however, that all three
of these problems are NP-hard, in particular, #P-complete. In the process, we show
that several counting problems are also #P-complete, among them" counting the
number of node covers in a bipartite graph, counting antichains in a partial order,
and countingminimumcardinality directednetwork cuts.
We now fix some terminology. Let G (V,E) be a graph with vertex set V and
vI IEI.
edge set E and let rn and n When specified, G directed.implies that the
edgesaretakentobeorderedpairs,andG undirectedimpliesthepairsareunordered.
When not specified, G is allowed to be either. We allow loops (edges whose two end
points are the same) and multiple edges (edges with the same pair of end points),
although these are not strictly required for the results of this paper. Let s and be
two vertices in the graph G (directed or undirected). An (s, t)-path in G is any
sequence s =v0, el, vl,..., Vk-1, ,ek, Vk =t of vertices Vo, v,.., and edges e,

minimal set of edges that contains paths from s to all other vertices in G. Note that
if G is undirected, a network cut comprises any minimal set of edges whose removal
disconnects G and a spanning tree is any minimal set of edges that connects all
vertices; in both cases the definition is independent of the choice of s.
We now define our reliability measures. Given any real p, 0<_-p-<_1, we impose
the stochastic structure on G in which the edges of G are subject to random failure,
independently and each with equal probabilityp. Edges that have not failed are said
to be operative. We are concerned with two composite reliability measures on this
stochastic model, which we will denote as functions of p. The first is the (s, t)
connectedness measure" given verticess and t in G,
f(G,s,t;p) Pr{thereisapathofoperativeedgesfromstot}
Pr{thefailededgesofGdonotcontainan(s,t)-cut}.
The second is the connectedness measure" given vertexs in G,
g(G,s;p) Pr{there is a path of operative edges from s to everyother vertex in G}
Pr{the failed edges of G do not contain a network cut}.
Thesemeasuresaredefinedforbothdirectedandundirectedgraphs.IfGisundirected,
thenf(G,s;p)istheprobabilitythattheoperativeedgesin G formaconnectedgraph

reliability measures can be seenbyexpandingfand g"

The use ofthisformofthepolynomialmightseemslightlyunnaturalsincecoefficients

Thus, the evaluation of f and g depend on the counting problems associated with
(s, t)-cuts and network cuts in away thatwillbe shown preciselybelow.
We explore the computational complexity of counting and reliability problems
in the manner proposed by Valiant [12]. The study of the complexity of feasibility
and optimization problems has been pursued in the setting of recognition problems
[5]. An important class is NP, which consists of those recognition problems accepted
by a nondeterministicTuring machine of polynomial time complexity. The "hardest"
problems in NP are called NP-complete; it is generally considered unlikely that
polynomial algorithms exist for solving problems in this class. Valiant defines #P to
be the set of integer-valued functions that can be computed by counting the number

the complexity of counting and reliability problems. We remark that the counting
problem associated with a given recognition problem is at least as hard as the
recognition problem. In particular, the counting versions of NP-complete problems
are NP-hard, i.e. at least as hard as NP-complete problems. To illustrate this point,
note that a polynomial algorithm to determine the number of Hamiltonian circuits in
a graph would imme_diately give a polynomial algorithm to determine if a graph
contained at least one Hamiltonian circuit. In fact, the counting versions of most

Before going on to the proof of the theorem, we illustrate how our results fit in
with previous results concerning reliability and important related counting problems.
Computation of the functions f and g are considered the two most important and
well-studied network reliability problems. The theorem settles the complexity of
computing g exactly and the e-approximation problem for f and g. In terms of
computingor approximatingf, two important quantities are the number of minimum
cardinality (s, t)-cuts and the number of minimum cardinality (s, t)-paths. These
correspond, respectively, tothe firstfi<(7) andthe lastfi>0. The two corresponding
quantities for g are the number ofminimumcardinalitynetworkcuts andthe number
of minimum cardinality connected sets, i.e. spanning trees, and these correspond,
respectively, to the first gg<(,".) and the last g>0. Table 1 describes the known

9 and 10 of the theorem.
2. Proofotthetheorem. Theformatforestablishingafunctionfas P-complete
is as follows. We first establish thatfis in 4P byshowing that, for any input z, there
exists a polynomial algorithm for recognizing structures associated with the input z
whose number is f(z). In the context of the functions given in the theorem this is a
trivial matter, since virtually all thefunctions count easily=recognizable objects in the
graph G a =ssociated with the input z. To show that f is P-complete, we start with
a known P-complete function g, andshowthat there exists an algorithmwhich, for
any z, evaluates g(z) using a polynomial number of evaluations off. In many cases
this simply involves altering the input z (here the graph G) in polynomial time to a
new input z’ (here a new graph G’) for which g(,z)=f(z’). In some cases, however,
,
we must evaluatef for a number of inputs z z,, that number beingpolynomial
in the size of z. We then relate the values f(z), 1,..., n to the value of g by

where the aj a,re known and g(z) is some simple function of the b. If we can show
that the k k matrix of the coefficients a for (1) is nonsingular, we can perform k
evaluationsof andthensolvethelinear system toobtain the values ofb, andhence
the value of g(z).

about these matrices (see, for example [7, 5.1]) is detA=l-I>i (tz-/z). We have

We will make repeated use of this lemma throughout the proof of the theorem.
It is easy to see that the problems 1-10 of the theorem are in #P. To show that
-
they are #P-complete, we establish a sequence of reductions, starting with the
followingcountingproblem.

by adding vertices {v’:v V} to V and pendant edges M {(v, v’):v V} to E. Now
sinceM consists of m disjointedgesthatcoverallverticesof G (aperfect matching),
it follows that a minimum cardinality vertex cover of G’ is of cardinality m. Further-
more, there is a 1-1 correspondence between vertex covers of G and minimum

In view of the discussion in reductions 2 and 3, it follows easily that the bipartite

the graph G’ with vertices VLI{s, t} and edges consisting ofE along with setsM’o of
multiple edges of the type (s, v), v e V1 or (v, t), v V2 with multiplicity equal to the
degree of v in G. An example of this construction is given in Fig. 3. Now a minimum
FIG.3. Exampleoftransformationusedinreduction 6.
cardinality (s, t)-cut in G’ is of cardinality [El, since (a) E is an (s, t)-cut and (b) an
IEI
(s, t)-flow of size can be obtained by directing all edges from s to and giving
each a flow of 1. It is clear that if a minimum cardinality (s, t)-cut C’ of G’ contains
one edge of a set M’o then it must contain every edge in M’o. Further, if the edges
(s, v) and (w, t) are in C’, then (v, w) cannot be an edge, since we can obtain a cut
with one less edge by replacingM’o andM’w with all edges in E adjacent to either v
or w. Thus, the sets M’o of C’ have ends in G which are independent in G and the
remaining edges in C’ must be all those edges in E which do not have a vertex in
commonwiththese sets. Conversely, anysetofedgesofthistype mustbe aminimum
cardinality (s, t)-cut in G’. Thus, there is a one to one correspondence between
minimum cardinality (s, t)-cutsin G’ andindependentsetsin G. Thereduction is now
complete. Note that this reduction applies in both the directed and undirected cases.

The use of multiple edges could have been avoided butwe omit the argumentfor the
sake ofsimplicity.
7. DIRECTED MINIMUM CARDINALITY (s,t)-CUT oc MINIMUM
CARDINALITY DIRECTED NETWORK CUT. Given directed graph G=
(V,E), s, t V, let k be the cardinality of a minimum cardinality (s, t)-cut. (It is well
known that k can be calculated in polynomial time using a network flow algorithm.)
Construct directed graph G’ from G by adding multiple edges of the form (t, v) with
multiplicity k+1 for each v V-{s,t}. Fig.4 illustrates this transformation. Now any
G
FIG.4. Exampleoftransformationusedinreduction 7.
minimumcardinality (s, t)-cut in G remains anetworkcutin G’ since all ofthe added
edges point out of t. Thus, the size of a minimum cardinality network cut in G’ is at
most k. Butsince removal of anyset$ of atmost k edgesfromE’ mustleave at least
one edge from to every vertex x s in V, then $ is a network cut in G’ if and only
if $ is an (s, t)-cut in G. Therefore, the minimum cardinality network cuts for G’ are
of cardinality k, and they consist precisely of sets of edges which are (s, t)-cuts for G.
This completes the reduction. As in the previous argument, the use of multiple edges
could have been avoided.

where gj is the number of sets of edges of cardinality/" whose complement admits a

bi (p/(1-pi)) for =0,..., m,/"=0,..., n is Vandermonde for any choice 0<
po"" <p,<1. Therefore, by evaluating g(G,s;p)/(1-p)" for i=0, ,n, and

the cardinality of a minimum cardinality (s,t)-cut. Then the complement of any set
of k edges that contains an (s, t)-cut must allow a path from every vertex to either s
or t (otherwise, an edge could be added to the component containing a vertex not
connected to either s or and still not allow a path from s or t). Thus g’k--gk is the
number of minimum cardinality (s, t)-cuts in G. As in problem 8A, by evaluating

that a seemingly more difficult unsolved problem involves the case where c (or e) is

We complete our discussion by considering the complexity of certain reliability

problem (7), however, is polynomial, and, in fact, the connectedness reliability prob-
lems (8 and 9) are also polynomial (see [3]). The second class of graphs is that of
planargraphs (directedandundirected). Here,boththeminimumcardinalitynetwork
cut problem and the minimum cardinality (s, t)-cut problem are polynomial (see also
[3]). The complexity of the reliability problems, however, are open questions. Table
2 summarizes known results forthese classes ofgraphs.

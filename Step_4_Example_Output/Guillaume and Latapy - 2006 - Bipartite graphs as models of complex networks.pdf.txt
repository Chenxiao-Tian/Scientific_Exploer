dense: one could say that real-world bipartite networks are bi-clusterized while random ones
are not, even if they capture the most common properties.
There are many directions in which this work may be extended. Solving the previous
drawback is one of them. This model might also be extended to the case of directed and
weighted graphs. These problems rely on giving a new definition to the concept of clique
which can be used in this context.
Another similar problem occurs when the graph is only partially known. In this case,
some edges are missing, which might yield to only trivial cliques. A solution to this problem
could be to study a model with quasi-cliques. Embedding this concept in the bipartite vision
however is nontrivial and remains to be done.
One may also use this model to deepen the study of some phenomena of high interest like
the robustness of networks, the spread of rumors and diseases, etc. The random graph model
with prescribed degree distribution already led to important advances on these questions
[19, 20, 52, 58]. They should now be extended to the bipartite models in order to evaluate
the impact of clustering on these problems. We argue that this is a strength of our approach
since results on random graphs with prescribed degrees can be directly adapted to our model
in order to take the clustering into account.
Finally, let us emphasize on the fact that the study of real-world complex networks is
only at its beginning. The discovery of their statistical properties, the analysis of the impact
of these properties, their integration into accurate models, and the use of these models in
simulation and analysis are key issues for our understanding of real-world complex networks,
which has crucial fundamental and applicative implications. Our work lies in this context.
It proposes a solution to the problem of the realistic random modeling of real-world complex
networks (in the sense of the three main observed properties), and it points out some relevant
directions for further research.

Abstract
It appeared recently that the classical random graph model used to represent real-
world complex networks does not capture their main properties. Since then, various
attempts have been made to provide accurate models. We study here a model which
achieves the following challenges: it produces graphs which have the three main wanted
properties (clustering, degree distribution, average distance), it is based on some real-
world observations, and it is sufficiently simple to make it possible to prove its main
properties. This model consists in sampling a random bipartite graph with prescribed
degree distribution. Indeed, we show that any complex network may be viewed as a
bipartite graph with some specific characteristics, and that its main properties may be
viewed as consequences of this underlying structure. We also propose a growing model
based on this observation.
Introduction.
It has been shown recently that most real-world complex networks have some specific prop-
erties in common. These properties are not captured by the model generally used before
this discovery, although they play a central role in many contexts like the robustness of the
Internet [6, 15, 19, 20, 49], the spread of viruses or rumors over the Internet, the Web or
other social networks [48, 52, 58], the performance of protocols and algorithms [36, 41, 68],
and many other.
This is why a strong effort has been put in the realistic modeling of complex networks
in the last few years, and much progress has been accomplished in this field. Some models
achieve the aim of producing graphs which capture some, but not all of the main properties
of real-world complex networks. Some models obtain all the wanted properties but rely on
artificial methods which give unrealistic graphs (trees, graphs with uniform degrees, etc).
Others rely on construction processes which may induce some hidden properties, or are too
difficult to analyze.
Inthispaper,weproposetherandombipartitegraphmodelasageneralmodelforcomplex
networks. We will show that this model produces graphs with many observed properties. It
relies on real-world observations and gives realistic graphs. Finally, it is simple enough to
make it possible to prove its main properties. We will also discuss some identified drawbacks
of this model.
We will first present an overview of the context in which our work lies. In particular,
we use some ideas introduced in previous papers, which we need to describe precisely. Then
1
we show how all complex networks may be described as bipartite structures. After this,
we present the random bipartite model and analyze it to show that the main properties of
complex networksaresomehowaconsequenceoftheirunderlyingbipartitestructure. Wealso
presenta growing bipartite modelbased on thesame ideas. Finally wediscuss theadvantages
and limitations of these models.
1 Context.
Throughout our presentation, we will use a representative set of complex networks which
have received much attention and span quite well the variety of contexts in which complex
networks appear: an Internet graph at router level [16, 32, 33] consisting of physical links
between routers ; a web graph from Notre Dame university [5, 23] whereweb pages are linked
by hyperlinks ; a co-occurence graph in which words are linked if they belong to a same
sentence in a given text [31, 67] ; the actor graph where actors are linked when they have
played together [24, 70] ; a co-authoring graph from Arxiv [7] where scientists are linked if
they have signed a paper together [50, 51, 56]; and finally a protein graph where two proteins
of a given biological system are linked if they influence each other [23, 35].
Manyothercomplexnetworkshavebeenstudied. Referto[4,26,54]foramoredescriptive
list of networks and corresponding references. All these networks have some properties in
common which have been discovered quite recently and have concentrated a large attention
invariouscommunities. Hereafterwepresentthepropertiesinconcernandsomerecentefforts
in the modeling of these properties.
1.1 Statistical properties
Most real-world complex networks have a number of edges m which scales linearly with the
number of vertices n: m ∼k·n where k is the average degree (which does not depend on the
size of the graph). Therefore, these networks have a low density (going to 0 when n grows),
the density beingdefined as the numberof existing edges over the numberof edges that could
exist (n(n−1)/2).
The distance between two vertices, defined as the number of edges on a shortest path
between these vertices, is low on average. It is a well known property on social networks since
the work of Stanley Milgram [43] and the notion of “six degrees of separation”. However it
appearedmorerecently thatallcomplex networks have alow average distancewhichtypically
scaleslikethelogarithmofthesizeofthegraph. Ithasbeenshownthatthisisactuallytruefor
anygraphwhichcontains somereasonableamountofrandomness. Actually, underreasonable
assumptions, the average distance in random graphs scales even slower than the logarithm1
of their size [13, 18, 21, 28, 39, 55, 56].
The local clustering, or clustering coefficient [70] is defined for each vertex of degree at
|{(x,y),x,y∈N(u)}|
least 2 as the proportion of edges between its neighbors: c(u) = , where d(u)
(d(u))
2
is the degree of vertex u and N(u) is the set of neighbors of u. The clustering of a graph is
simply the average over all vertices. All real-world complex networks have a high clustering
which seems to be independent of the size of the network. These graphs are locally dense
while globally sparse.

wegive itsnumberofvertices n,itsnumberoflinksm,itsdensity, thevalueoftheexponentα
of the power law that fits bestits degree distribution, its clustering c, and its average distance

Finally, the degree distribution which is, for each k, the probability p that a randomly
k
chosen vertex has degreek, iscompletely differentfromwhatwas expected. Indeedforalmost
all real-world complex networks, the degree distribution follows a power law: p ∼ k−α, while
k
one would have expected an exponential decrease (Poisson-like distributions). The exponent
αofthepowerlawisgenerallybetween2and3. Suchadistributionmeansthatalthoughmost
vertices have a small degree, the number of vertices with degree k decays only polynomially
with k, and therefore there is a significant number of vertices with high degree.
The main properties of the real-world complex networks we use in this paper are given in
Table 1. Notice that, as announced, all these real-world complex networks have a very low
density, a low average distance, a power law distribution of degrees and a high clustering.
The similarity of these networks concerning unexpected properties has led to the study
of other properties. The simplest one concerns the degree-degree correlation: what is the
average degree of the neighbors of a vertex of degree k. Three main behaviors are expected,
either high-degree vertices tend to connect to high-degree vertices, or to low-degree vertices,
or to any nodes. These behaviors can be observed using the the slope (increasing, decreasing
or constant) of theplot whichrelates theaverage degreeof theneighborsof nodes of degree k,
to k [11, 63, 64], or with a single parameter (assortativity coefficient), which may be positive
(assortative networks), negative (dissortative networks) or null (neutral networks) [53]. Most
socialnetworksareassortative(similarverticesareconnected)whiletechnologicalorbiological
are generally dissortative [53].
One may also correlate the clustering and the degree by computing the average cluster-
ing of vertices with a given degree. This also defines assortative (high degree yields high
clustering), neutral or dissortative networks.
Finally, other properties have been studied, such as the centrality (how many shortest
paths contain a given vertex) [51], the distribution of eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix
[30, 42], etc. All these statistical properties are used to describe a given complex network
and to study the similarities and differences between several complex networks. They give
precise insight on what one may expect when considering a complex network having a set of
properties.

1.2 Modeling complex networks
The basic model for complex networks is the Erd¨os-R´enyi (ER) random graph model [13, 29].
n·(n−1)
In a random graph with n vertices, each of the possible edges exists with a given
2
probability p (this model is know as G ). The average distance of G scales with the
n,p n,p
logarithm of n [13]. Moreover, the clustering is equal to the connection probability p since
each pair of vertices is connected with the same probability independently of the fact that
they are both linked to a same vertex. If m ∼ k ·n as in real-world complex networks, this
means that the clustering scales as n−1 and therefore tends to 0 when n grows. Finally, the
degree distribution follows a Poisson law p ∼
e−λλk
[13], which implies in particular that all
k k!
vertices have nearly the same degree.
Therefore, although this model can be considered as relevant concerning the average dis-
tance, itmisses two main properties of real-world complex networks. Inparticular, thedegree
distributions are qualitatively different.
Itishoweverpossibletosampleuniformlyarandomgraphwithagivendegreedistribution
(in particular a power law) [10, 12, 40, 45, 46] using the configuration model, or Molloy and
Reed2 (MR) model: for each vertex, draw its degree at random according to the given
distribution, create as many connection points as its degree and finally connect pairs of
connection points at random3.
The power law graphs obtained this way have an average distance which scales slower
that the logarithm of their size [18, 21, 28, 39, 55, 56]. Moreover, the fact that vertices are
linked together purely at random (only their number of edges is given) makes it possible to
study the properties of the obtained graphs, and it indeed seems that it captures some of the
most important behaviors of complex networks [2, 18, 39, 54, 58]. However, under reasonable
assumptions on the degree distribution, the clustering of these graphs tends to zero when n
grows [54].
This approach could in principle be continued to sample a graph among the ones having
a given number of nodes, a given degree distribution and a given clustering. However, until
now, there is no known method to sample uniformly such a graph, and the problem seems
difficult.
On the other hand, a large variety of models based on the iteration of a construction
process inspired from the way complex networks grow in reality have been introduced.
The first generic model of real-world complex networks, has been introduced in 1998 by
Watts and Strogatz (WS) [70]. One starts with a ring of n vertices in which each vertex is
connected to its k nearest neighbors, for a given k. Then, each edge is rewired with a given
probability p by choosing randomly a new extremity. When p is small the graph is almost a
ring which have high average distance and high clustering. On the opposite, when p is high,
the graph is nearly random. For medium values of p, the graph has both a small average
distance and a high clustering, but the degree distribution of the obtained graphs does not
follow a power law [25, 70].

here.
3Notethatthisalgorithmmayinducemultiplelinksandloops. Onemayalsousetechniquestoavoidthem,
see for instance [38, 44], but thisis out of thescope of this paper.

Another important step was done with models based on preferential attachment. [3, 27,
37]. The “rich gets richer” principle can be derived in a model where vertices arrive one by
one in a graph and choose their neighbors with a probability proportional to the degree of
these neighbors. This model has been studied intensively and is now well known [4]: the
degree distribution follows a power law with exponent, the average distance is logarithmic
in the number of vertices, and the clustering is low, going to 0 when the number of vertices
grows. Despite this last point, this model has received much attention, in particular because
it defines growing graphs.
Both the WS model and the AB one have been introduced to model generic behavior of
complex networks. If they both fail in producing graphs having each of the three properties
we cited, they have been widely used as building blocks for more complex models.
Table 2 shows the performances obtained with the basic models we cited in our practical
cases. Let us insist on the fact that the models seek qualitative properties (non negligible
clustering, power law degree distribution, etc). Their aim is not to produce graphs with
exactlygivenvaluesfortheseproperties. However,evenwiththisinmind,thegraphsobtained
using these models are significantly different from real-world ones concerning at least one of
these three points.

Table 2: Performance of the main generic models for complex networks. For each network,
we give its number of vertices n, its number of links m, its clustering c, and its average
distance d. Moreover, we give the values of these parameters for typical graphs with the
same number of vertices and edges obtained with ER, MR, AB and WS models. Moreover,
in The cases pointed by a star (*), the real clustering is too large to be obtained with the
WS model. Therefore we used in these cases the parameters inducingthe maximal clustering,
which yields very large average distances.
Many other attempts have been made to reach the goal of obtaining models which give
graphs having each of the three main properties we have cited. Most of them are described in
[4,26,62]. Somedeterministicmodels,whichwedonotdetailhere, havealsobeenintroduced
[8, 22] which produce the wanted properties and are suitable for analysis. However, they
cannot beconsidered as realistic and theobtained graphs have specificproperties which make
them very different from real-world complex networks.
5
Another model is the Dorogovstev and Mendes (DM) model which generates highly clus-
terised graphs with a power law degree distribution [26]. In this model, at each step a vertex
is created, anedgeis chosen atrandomandthenewvertex isconnected tobothextremities of
the edge. Since high-degree vertices have more edges, they are more likely to be chosen. The
hidden preferential attachment and the creation of triangles induces the wanted properties.
However theparameters ofthis modelcannotbetunedandithassomeunexpectedproperties
(for instance, there is no node of degree 1 and it produces planar graphs4). Therefore we are
not going to use it hereafter.
More recent models [9, 59, 60, 61, 65, 66, 69] have been introduced. Some of them use
the preferential attachement principle, and create some triangles at each step. In [59], for
each newly created edge, a triangle is built using both extremities of this edge and a neighbor
of the old vertex. In [69], a step of the algorithm consists either in the creation of a new
vertex with m edges or in the creation of m edges between neighbors of preferentially chosen
vertices.
The model introduced in [60] is an evolution of the configuration model in which both the
degree distributionand theclustering distributioncan bepre-defined. Connections points are
createdforeachvertexinthefuturenetworkandafirststepconsistsincreatingtrianglesusing
these connections points. A second step closes the graph by connecting unused connections.
In this paper, we propose a solution to the random sampling of graphs which have all
the three wanted properties. To achieve this, we focus on another property of all real-world
complex networks, namely theirunderlyingbipartitestructure,inSection2. Wethenpropose
two models: the random sampling of bipartite graphs with prescribed degree distributions,
and the growing bipartite model with preferential attachment in Section 3. Indeed, as shown
in Sections 4 and 5, respectively formally and experimentally, these models induce the three
wanted properties. This means that they can be viewed as consequences of the underlying
bipartite structure of all complex networks, which is our main contribution.
2 Complex networks as bipartite graphs
A bipartite graph is a triple G = (⊤,⊥,E) where ⊤ and ⊥ are two disjoint sets of vertices,
respectively the top and bottom vertices, and E ⊆ ⊤×⊥ is the set of edges. The difference
with classical graphs lies in the fact that edges exist only between top vertices and bottom
vertices.
Two degree distributions can naturally be associated to such a graph, namely the top
|{t∈⊤:d(t)=k}| |{t∈⊥:d(t)=k}|
degree distribution: ⊤ = andthe bottom degree distribution: ⊥ = .
k |⊤| k |⊥|
These two distributions play a central role in the following.
Natural bipartite structures
As already noticed for instance in [34, 55], some complex networks display a natural bipartite
structure. Among our examples, one can view Actors (two actors are linked if they are part
of a same cast) as a bipartite graph where ⊤ is the set of movies, ⊥ is the set of actors, and
each actor is linked to the movies he/she played in. Coauthoring can also be viewed this way
4Agraphisplanariffitcanbeembeddedintheplanesothatnoedgesintersect. Sinceedgesaretransformed
in triangles, one can easily be convinced that one step of thealgorithm does not create edges intersections.

with ⊤ being the set of papers and ⊥ being the set of authors, each author being linked to
the papers he/she (co-)signed. Likewise, in Cooccurrence one can link each sentence to the
words it contains.
Given a bipartite graph G = (⊤,⊥,E), one can easily obtain its classical version, also
called the one-mode or ⊥-projection, defined as G′ = (⊥,E′) where {u,v} is in E′ if u and
v are both connected to a same (top) node in G. See Figure 1 for an example. From the
bipartite versions of Actors, Coauthoring andCooccurrence graphs, onecan then recover their
classical versions. In the ⊥-projection of a bipartite graph, each top vertex induces a clique
(complete subgraph) between the bottom vertices to which it is linked: all actors of a given
movie have played together therefore they must be all linked.

twice since B and C have two neighbors in common in the bipartite network.
However, giventhe⊥-projectionofabipartitegraph,itisingeneralnotpossibletorecover
the bipartite graph from which it has been obtained in an unique way. Similarly if a graph is
not naturally bipartite there may exist many bipartite versions of it.
Recovering a bipartite structure
For the sake of completeness, we now recall anddetail thedecomposition scheme we proposed
in[34]which,givenagraph,producesabipartitegraphwhose⊥-projectionistheinitialgraph.
The aim of this scheme is to obtain a bipartite graph whose properties are similar to the ones
met in natural bipartite graphs, namely the number of top vertices has the same order of
magnitude as the number of bottom vertices and there are some high-degree top nodes (see
below and Figure 5).
First notice that the decomposition scheme is nothing but a clique covering problem: it
computes a set of cliques (which will correspond to the top nodes in the bipartite graph)
such that each edge belongs to at least one clique (which ensures that the ⊥-projection of the
decomposition is exactly the original graph). Simple ideas to cover the graph with cliques
might be to consider each edge as a clique, or to consider all maximal cliques. However, the
first approach would not yield large cliques while the second one could yield too many cliques
(the number of maximal cliques may be exponential).
To reach our goal, we proposed [34] the following decomposition. We pick for each edge
a largest clique containing it: a clique whose size is maximal among the ones containing the
edge. Noticethatthiscliquemaycontainonlytwovertices. Moreover, ifthereareseveralsuch
cliques for the same edge, we pick one at random. This decomposition ensures the complete
covering of the graph. Moreover, the number of cliques is at most equal to the number of
edges, which is of the order of the number of vertices. Finally, since we take largest cliques,
we expect to find most of the large cliques contained in the graph.
In the case of Figure 1 we obtain several cliques of size 2 (namely {C,E} and {D,F}),
and we have to choose at random between {A,B,C} and {B,C,D} when considering the
7
edge {B,C}. However, these two cliques are obtained from other edges, and we finally obtain
a unique decomposition which is nothing but the bipartite graph on the left of the figure.
The central aim of our decomposition scheme is, given the ⊥-projection of a natural
bipartite graph, to producean artificial bipartite graph similar to the original bipartite graph
itself. A way to evaluate it is therefore to decompose the ⊥-projection version of a natural
bipartite complex network and to compare the obtained bipartite network to the original one.
This is what we do in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Original clique size distribution for Actors, Cooccurrence and Coauthoring, and
extracted clique sizes distribution with the decomposition scheme.
The obtained distributions display some differences for the three graphs decomposed.
First, the decomposition scheme produces no cliques of size 1 since the smallest extracted
element is the edge (a 2-clique). Moreover, many 2-cliques have not been found, which means
thatthese2-cliques arenotmaximalintheoriginalgraph. For cliques ofsizemorethan2,our
extraction algorithm has been able to find most cliques, or even more. Such new large cliques
are induced by the overlapping of other cliques. Notice that in the case of Cooccurrence there
are many new very large cliques which have been created by overlapping, while in Actors and
Coauthoring this phenomena is very weak. We will discuss more about the overlapping in
the conclusion. Despite these differences, the obtained size distributions are similar to the
original ones in the sense that we obtain a nontrivial number of large cliques and a similar
number of cliques, which are the two main points here.
Practical computation
Notice that minimizing the number of cliques leads to the minimal clique covering problem
which is known to be NP-complete [47, 57]. Computing maximal cliques of a graph is also
NP-complete [1, 14] and so is the computation of the largest clique containing a given edge
{u,v}. However, some heuristics make it possible to compute it if the graph is not too large.
In our case, we use the following remarks. Let us denote the sets of neighbors of a vertex and
an edge by N(u) = {v ∈ V|{u,v} ∈ E} and N(u,v) = N(u)∩N(v) respectively. The largest
clique containing {u,v} in G is C∪{u,v}, where C is the largest clique in the sub-graph of G
induced by N(u,v). Figure 3 illustrates this process.
Recall that the decomposition process relies on a NP-complete problem in general. How-
ever, we observed that in real-world complex networks, the sub-graphs induced by N(u,v)
for all edges {u,v} are in general very dense and very small (Figure 4), which is due to the
high clustering and to the power law degree distribution, respectively. The small size makes
it possible to compute the largest clique containing {u,v} very efficiently in practice.

by N(u) ∩ N(v) = N(u,v) = {b,c,d} since the clique we are looking for is nothing but
C ∪{u,v} which, in our case, gives {u,v,b,c}

Properties of the bipartite graphs
Given the general decomposition scheme, we can now transform any complex network into
a bipartite graph. Figure 5 shows the top and bottom degree distribution for the natural
bipartite networks Actors, Cooccurrence andCoauthoring, and theones obtained for Internet,
Web and Proteins graphs using our decomposition scheme.
All these distributions have a property in common: bottom degree distributions fit very
well power laws in all cases. On the contrary, the top degree distributions are of two kinds:
while Cooccurrence, Coauthoring, Internet and Proteins ones exhibit a Poisson behavior,
Actors and Web ones are more heavy tailed.
These results lead to several remarks. First, the presence of a power law bottom degree
distribution seems universal, just like the power law distribution in the ⊥-projection of these
graphs, but the effective exponent is not and depends on the considered complex network.
Second, the top degree distributions can be qualitatively different and this point is important
in the use of the bipartite structure for modeling complex networks since it can impact on
somecharacteristicsofthegeneratedgraphs. FurtherremarkswillbepointedoutinSection6.
Note also that the degree of a vertex in the ⊥-projection is the sum of the degrees of the
top vertices to which it is connected in the bipartite graph, minus the number of vertices in
common in the neighborhood of these vertices. One can easily be convinced that this overlap
between neighborhoods,ifany, can have agreat impactonthedegree distribution. Todeepen
this notion of overlap, one can observe the correlation between the bottom vertex degrees in

Finally, we have shown in this section that all complex networks have a nontrivial under-
lyingbipartite structure, which can becomputed usingour decomposition scheme. This leads
us to the following question: is it possible to see the main properties of real-world complex
networks as consequences of their underlying bipartite structure? We answer this question in
the next sections.
3 The bipartite models.
Our aim is now to use the new general property of real-world complex networks discovered
in the previous section, namely their underlying bipartite structure, as a way to propose a
model which captures the main wanted properties.
As discussed in the first section of this paper, there are basically two ways to achieve this
goal. First, we may try to sample random bipartite graphs with prescribed (top and bottom)
degree distributions. Second, we may try to propose a construction process similar to the
ones observed in practice, to obtain a growing model.
10
We proposed such models in [34]. In order to deepen the understanding of these models,
wehererecallanddiscussmoreprecisely theirdefinitions,andweprovideafull(bothanalytic
and experimental) analysis in the next sections.
Random sampling of bipartite graphs with prescribed degree distribution
Onecan sampleuniformlyarandombipartite graphwith prescribed(top and bottom)degree
distributions in the spirit of the configuration model as follows (see Figure 7) [17, 55, 56]:
1. generate both top and bottom vertices and assign to each vertex a degree drawn from
the given distributions,
2. create for each vertex as many connection points as its degree,
3. link top and bottom connection points randomly,
Figure7: Constructionof arandombipartitegraphwithprescribeddegreedistributions: first
top and bottom vertices are drawn and each vertex is assigned a degree with respect to the
given distributions, then edges are chosen randomly between the two sets.
This process generates random bipartite graphs uniformly within the set of bipartite
graphs with the given degree distributions. However it cannot be used without taking care
of the following constraints: top and bottom distributions cannot be arbitrary since they
must allow the total degree of both sets to be equal. Actually one only has to ensure that
the number of vertices times the mean of the distribution brings the same value for top and
bottom sets. The second problem arises with the fact that even if the two distributions are
theoretically consistent, two sets of degrees experimentally drawn from these distributions
can be inconsistent (the sums of the degrees are different). A classical trick, which induces no
bias, consists in dropping one top and one bottom vertex at random and redraw their degree
[55, 56]. This last step may have to be done more than once before one obtains correct values
but finally the implementation and use of the model is very simple and efficient [17].
Note that, justlike with the MR model, multiple edges may appear. Again, onecan easily
show that they can be neglected when the graph is large. Moreover, some approaches exist
[38, 44] which can easily be modified to obtain random bipartite graphs without multiples
edges. This is however out of the scope of this paper.
Growing bipartite model with preferential attachment
Therandombipartitemodelassumesthattwodistributions,forbothtopandbottomdegrees,
are explicitly given. One can also use other rules (preferential attachment for instance) to
definethem implicitly andintroduceagrowingmodel. Indeed,asalready noticed, thebottom
degree distributions follow a power law. This leads to the following model: at each step, a
new top vertex is added and its degree d is sampled from a prescribed (top) distribution
(which qualitatively varies between graphs). Then, for each of the d edges of the new vertex,
11
either a new bottom vertex is added (with probability 1 − λ) or one is picked among the
preexisting ones using preferential attachment (with probability λ). The parameter λ is the
overlap ratio, defined as the average ratio of preexisting bottom vertices to which a new top
vertex is connected.
It is generally not possible to know exactly the order in which cliques are created on real-
|⊥|
world bipartite graphs, but the average ratio can be computed globally as λ = 1− . One
Pd
⊤
can compute it and get 0.733 for Actors, 0.877 for Coauthoring and 0.949 for Cooccurrence.
Notice that 1−λ can be rewritten and is simply the inverse average bottom degree (since
d = d ), therefore a high overlap ratio yields a high average bottom degree (since only
⊤ ⊥
fPew nodePs are created at each time step).
At each step of the construction process, the bipartite graph has the required degree
distributions: the prescribed top degree distribution is obtained by construction while the
power law degree distribution is obtained using preferential attachment, which can be shown
formally in exactly the same way as in the original AB model [3]. Notice moreover that
this construction process is very similar to the one observed in some real-world cases. For
instance, Actors is built exactly this way: when a new movie is produced (which corresponds
to the addition of a top vertex), it is linked to actors according to their popularity, and to
some new actors, playing in a movie for the first time.
We finally have two models to produce bipartite networks similar to the ones obtained
from real-world complex networks, interms of top and bottom degree distributions. Thenext
question is toask if theycapturetheother propertiesof interest intheir ⊥-projection, namely
the average distance, the degree distribution and the clustering. We will answer positively to
this question with formal arguments and with experimental results in the next sections.
4 Analysis of the models.
Our aim in this section is to give formal proofs for the main properties of the ⊥-projection of
a random bipartite graph with prescribed degree distributions. Some of these properties, and
others, have been studied independently in [55, 56] with different techniques and a different
point of view. We however believe that our proofs give new insight on these properties,
therefore we give them below. In particular, our proof techniques may be considered as more
mathematically rigorous.
Since these properties are induced by a typical graph (this is what random sampling
gives us), this is a way to answer the following question: what properties are induced by
the underlying bipartite structure? In particular, can we see the main properties of real-
world complex networks, namely low average distance, power law degree distribution and
high clustering, as consequences of the underlying bipartite structure?
We will see that it is indeed the case. Notice that many other properties, like the size
distribution of the connected components for instance, are of high interest. It is shown in [55]
that under reasonable conditions on the degree distributions the ⊥-projection is connected,
or at least has a giant component. In all the practical cases, these conditions are fulfilled,
therefore we will restrict ourselves to this case.
12
Degree distribution
Let us first consider the degree distribution of the ⊥-projection of a random bipartite graph
G = (⊤,⊥,E). Given a bottom vertex u, we denote by d(u) the degree of u in the bipartite
graph, and by d (u) its degree in its ⊥-projection. We want to study the distribution of
U
d (u) (we actually deal here with the expected value for a randomly chosen u).
U
Lemma 1 Let us consider a bottom vertex u ∈ ⊥. The expected number of bottom vertices
which have a neighbor (in ⊤) in common with u, i.e. d (u), is:
U
d(u) d(u)2
· d(t)+O · d(t)2 
|⊤| |⊤|2
Xt6=u Xt6=u
 
(|⊤|−d(u))
Proof. The exact expected value of d (u) is given by d (u) = 1− d(t) since
U U t6=u(cid:18) (|⊤|) (cid:19)
P d(t)
the probability that a given bottom vertex t has a top neighbor in common with u depends
only on the degree of both vertices and the number of top vertices. To simplify this formula,
(|⊤|−d(u))
we can approximate the ratio |⊤|−d(u) / |⊤| as follows: d(t) = (|⊤|−d(u))!(|⊤|−d(t))! ∼
d(t) d(t) (|⊤|) |⊤|!(|⊤|−d(u)−d(t))!
(cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:0) (cid:1) d(t)

∼ 1− +O .
|⊤|d(u) |⊤| (cid:18) |⊤| (cid:19)
(cid:16) (cid:17)
Therefore: d (u) ∼ d(t)d(u) +O d(t)d(u) 2 ∼ d(u) d(t)+O d(u)2 d(t)2 ,
⊤ t=6 u(cid:18) |⊤| (cid:18) |⊤| (cid:19)(cid:19) |⊤| t6=u |⊤|2 t=6 u

Therefore, as long as the bottom degree distribution follows a power law, the degree
distributioninthe⊥-projectionofthegraphalsofollows apowerlaw withthesameexponent,
which is indeed the case in practice as one can check in Figures 8 and 5. The main reason
comes from the fact that ⊥-vertices are somehow randomly linked to ⊤-vertices and their
degree in the projection is therefore strongly correlated with their bipartire degree.
Average distance
To study the average distance in the ⊥-projection of a graph obtained with the model, we
will use a result from L. Lu about the diameter (i.e. the largest distance between any two
vertices) of some specific random graphs:
Theorem 1 [39]LetG = (V,E)beagraphwhoseverticesareweightedwithweightsw ,··· ,w ,
1 n
such that each edge {i,j} appears with probability w ·w ·p. If the degrees of the vertices in V
i j
follow a power law with an exponent β strictly greater than 2, then the diameter of the graph
G is almost surely Θ(log(n))5.
5f =Θ(g)if and only if f =O(g) and g=O(f)i.
13
This theorem, together with the one presented above on the degree distribution of the
⊥-projection of the graph, leads to the following result:
Theorem 2 Let G = (⊤,⊥,E) be a bipartite graph such that the bottom degree distribution
follows a power law with an exponent greater than 2. Then the diameter of the ⊥-projection
of G is almost surely Θ(log(|⊥|)).
Proof. Given two bottom vertices u and v in ⊥, the probability that they are connected in
the ⊥-projection is equal to the probability that they are both linked to a same top vertex
in G. This probability is exactly proportional to d (u) · d (v). Therefore we can apply
⊥ ⊥
Theorem 1 considering that the weight of each vertex is its degree and so the connection
probability is ensured, and as long as bottom degree distribution follows a power law with an
exponent β strictly greater than 2. The diameter of the ⊥-projection of the graph therefore
is almost surely Θ(log(|⊥|)). (cid:3)
Since the diameter is an upper bound for the average distance, this theorem implies that
the average distance of the ⊥-projection scales at most as fast as the logarithm of its number
of nodes. Notice that, as in the case of random networks [13, 18, 21, 28, 39, 55, 56], the
average distance may grow even slower.
Clustering
Recall that the clustering of a vertex v of degree at least 2 in a graph is the probability that
two of its neighbors are linked [70], i.e. the number of triangles to which v belongs over the
|△(v)|
number of connected triples centered on it: c(v) = . Then the clustering of the graph
|∧(v)|
is defined as: 1 c(v). We define the clustering of a vertex restricted to a part of its
N v,d(v)>1
neighborhood asPits clustering in the subgraph induced by this part of its neighborhood.
Hereafter we give a lower boundfor the clustering of a graph G′ which is the ⊥-projection
ofabipartitegraphG = (⊤,⊥,E)obtainedusingtherandombipartitemodel. Weshowthat,
under reasonable assumptions on the top and bottom degree distributions, it is boundedby a
value independent of the size of the graph. This shows that the model produces graphs with
nontrivial clustering.
Before entering in the core of this section, note that an approximation formula for the
clustering of such a graph is given in [55, 56]. Here we give an exact formula for a lower
bound. Both are interesting since the first one gives an expected value which is indeed very
close to the real value, while the second one gives a guaranty that the exact value is above
the given quantity. We used this approach because we seek qualitative results only, and so it
is sufficient for us to show that the clustering does not tend to 0 when the size of the graph
grows. The lower bound achieves this goal.
First, the probability for two top vertices to have more than one bottom vertex in com-
mon in their neighborhood tends to zero when the size of the graph grows. We therefore
consider any vertex b in the ⊥-projection of the graph and we suppose that its neighborhood
is composed of a set of disjoint cliques. We will prove the following:
• the effect of the number of top vertices of degree 2 to which b is connected on its
clustering is negligible, and
14
• the clustering of b can be bounded by a value which depends only on its degree.
Lemma 2 Let ⊤ denote the set of top neighbors of b in G with degree strictly greater than
>2
2, and ⊥ denote the set of bottom neighbors of ⊤ . Let p be the fraction of neighbors of b
>2 >2
which belong to ⊥ , and α be the clustering of b (in G′) restricted to ⊥ .
>2 >2
Then the clustering of b in G′ scales as p2·α.
Proof. The fact that the clustering of b restricted to ⊥ is α implies that |△ (b)| =
>2 ⊥>2
α · p·d . If we consider the whole neighborhood of b, instead of just ⊥ , the number of
2 >2
(cid:0) (cid:1) α·(p·d)
triangles does not change while the number of connected triples increases: c(b) = 2 =
(d)
2
α· p·d((p·d−1) ∼ p2·α which is the formula of the claim. (cid:3)
d(d−1)
Therefore, as long as p is a constant, one can neglect the top vertices of degree 2 when
computing the clustering of a given vertex. Now let us prove that the clustering of a bottom
vertex can be related to its degree.
Lemma 3 If b is connected only to top vertices of degree at least 3 in G, then:
1
c(b) ≥
2·d(b)−1
Proof. Suppose that b is connected to two top vertices, t and t , of degree at least 3 (we
1 2
(d(t1)−1)+(d(t2)−1)
deal with thegeneral case below). Thentheclustering of b is c(b) = 2 2 Suppose
(d(t1)+d(t2)−2)
2
now that b is connected to t and t′ such that d(t′) = d(t )+1, then the clustering of b is
2 1 1 1
c′(b) =
(d(t1) 2+1−1)+(d(t2 2)−1)
and c′(b) − c(b) = 2·(d(t2)−1) > 0, which means
(d(t1)+d(t2)−1) (d(t1)+d(t2)−2)·(d(t1)+d(t2)−3)
2
that the clustering grows with the degree of t and t . A lower bound for the clustering of b
1 2
can therefore be obtained when both t and t have the smallest possible degree: 3.
1 2
This can be extended to the case where b has more than two top neighbors to obtain the
P (d(ti)−1) P (3−1)
following lower bound c(b) = ti 2 ≥ ti 2 ≥ 1 , which is the formula of the
(Pti(d(ti)−1)) (Pti(3−1)) 2·d(b)−1
claim. 2 2 (cid:3)
The clustering of the ⊥-projection G′ can now be easily approximated:
1 1
c(G′)∼
N 2d(b)−1
bX∈⊥
As long as there is a linear number c·N of vertices b of degree 2, the sum scales linearly
with N: 1 ≥ 1 = c·N (we could have considered vertices of any
b∈⊥ 2·d(b)−1 b,d(b)=2 2·2−1 3
(cid:16) (cid:17)
constant Pdegree k insteadPof 2). Therefore the lower bound for the clustering is independent
of N. This holds in particular for power law networks since the number of vertices of degree
2 is of the order of N ·2−α.
Since we do notconsider top vertices of degree 2 in the last formula (due to Lemma 2), we
must also ensure that the number of such top neighbors represent at most a constant fraction
15
(not tending to 1) of the neighbors. This is indeed the case for most distributions and in
particular for the ones met in practice. We finally obtain that the clustering of the graph
is larger than a non-zero constant independently of the size of the graph. The idea behind
the proof is that each node belongs to a small number of cliques and even if these cliques are
disjoint, the clustering is still high.
5 Experimental results
Theformalresultsoftheprevioussection give apreciseintuition onhowtherandombipartite
graph model with prescribed degree distributions behaves. We can also check its properties
experimentally by generating graphs using this model and the same parameters as the ones
measured on real-world complex networks. This is what we do in this section with our six
examples, for the purely random bipartite model as well as for the one with preferential
attachment.
More precisely, the networks are generated using the models presented in section 3 with
⊤ and ⊥ distributions obtained either from the real graphs when they are known or from the
decomposition scheme introduced in section 2.

As expected from the previous section, the graphs obtained with the random bipartite
model have a power law distribution of degrees, a small average distance and a high cluster-
ing. Moreover, by definition, they have the same distribution of cliques size as the original
network. Therefore the model is qualitatively accurate for the modeling of general real-world
complex networks: the simulations fit real-world values qualitatively well for both clustering
and average distance, which proves the relevance of the underlying bipartite structure as an
essential property to characterize real-world complex networks.

Figure8: Theoriginaldegreedistributionofoursixexamples,togetherwiththeonesobtained
with the random bipartite model and with the growing bipartite model.
There are however differences between the values obtained from the bipartite models and
real-world networks. They are consequences of the following fact: in the original bipartite
networks (both natural ones and the ones obtained from the decomposition), many top nodes
have a large neighborhood intersection. In other words, the overlap between cliques is large
(if two cliques have one neighbor in common, they certainly have many). This behavior can
be viewed as a bipartite clustering and is not captured by the bipartite models. The random
linking implies that most cliques have only one vertex in common, if any. This is responsible
for both the inaccuracy of the models concerning some clusterings and for the irregularities
one can observe on some distributions. Figure 9 plots the distribution of the overlap between
cliques. This overlap is very small for all random bipartite graphs while it is non trivial for
the original graphs.

More precisely, in the case of Internet, we noticed the presence of a sub-graph of only 94
vertices which contains all the 494 cliques of size 14 and more. This very dense sub-graph
implies that the clustering of each of the 94 nodes is very high. However, they have almost no
impact on the clustering of the whole graph (due to the average). On the other hand, in the
⊥-projection of random bipartite networks, these large cliques are disseminated all over the
graph which brings two artifacts: there are a lot of vertices having a degree between 14 and
17
29 which explains the bump on degree distribution (a similar phenomenon can be observed
on Web), and the number of vertices with high clustering is drastically increased because of
their presence in large cliques (from 94 to 50,000).
These experimental results should also be compared to the ones obtained with the cur-
rently most used models, presented in Section 1. This comparison gives evidence for the fact
that the models we propose may be considered as an important step towards the realistic
modeling of complex networks.
All theseremarks holdbothfor thegrowing bipartitemodeland fortherandom one. This
is worth to notice, since it may be very important in some contexts that the model produces
growing graphs with realistic properties, and in other contexts that the obtained graphs are
representative of a precise class of graphs.
6 Conclusion and discussion
In this paper, we propose bipartite graphs as a general tool for the modeling of real-world
complex networks. They make it possible to achieve the following challenges:
• the obtained networks have the three main wanted properties (logarithmic average dis-
tance, high clustering and power law degree distribution),
• the models are based on a realistic construction process representative of what happens
in some real-world cases, and
• their definitions are simple enough to make it possible to give some intuition and some
proofs of their properties.
Moreover, they can be derived in two versions: one which relies on random sampling among
a class of graphs, and one which relies on an iterative construction process. This makes them
suitable for a wide variety of usages. Moreover, it is very simple to obtain graphs using this
model(weprovideageneratorat[17]),whichmakesithighlysuitableforsimulationpurposes.
The model is based on the discovery that all real-world complex networks have an under-
lying bipartite structure. Some networks naturally have this structure and, for the others, we
show that they can be decomposed into cliques which make such a structure emerge. This
shows that the main properties of complex networks can be viewed as consequences of this
bipartite structure, and that the model captures a general behavior of complex systems.
However, as already stressed in previous sections, the overlapping between cliques is not
taken into account by the bipartite model which in some way distributes cliques all over
the networks independently of the nodes implied. On the contrary, it seems obvious that
graphs such as Actors are not randomly constructed: actors from a same country are more
likely to play together, for instance. This lack of overlapping can also be described on the
bipartite graphs: if two top nodes have more than one bottom node in the intersection of
their neighborhood, then this yields a non trivial bipartite clique. On the other hand, for the
graphs generated with both bipartite models, most of these bipartite cliques are trivial ones
(as long as there are no too many cliques).
An analogy can be made with the clustering in random graphs (ER graphs for instance),
in which neighborhoods of vertices are very sparse while real-world neighborhoods are quite

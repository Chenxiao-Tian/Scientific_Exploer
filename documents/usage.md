### Installation

### Installation

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, you need to clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine. You can do this using Git command-line tools or directly through an IDE that supports Git operations. Hereâ€™s how to do it via the command line:

Open your command line interface (Terminal on macOS and Linux, Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows).
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Run the Git clone command with the URL of the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cis-teaching/challenge_2_SciNetExplorer.git
```
####  Step 2: Set Up a Python Environment
It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies:

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash

cd challenge_2_SciNetExplorer
```
Create a virtual environment (replace venv with your desired environment name):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
#### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the project dependencies which are usually listed in a requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Step 4: Install the Package
If the package is meant to be installed locally (assuming it includes a setup.py file):


```bash
pip install .
```

This command will install the current package and all its dependencies.
#### Step 5: Post-Installation
For the later module 5 analysis, after installing the SciNetExplorer package, you need to download the necessary spaCy language model. Run the following command:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
